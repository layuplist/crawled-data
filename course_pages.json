The class will also analyze the socio-political events in particular nations and the ways in which these events influence writing in the archipelago. We will also examine the ways in which a strong tradition of music as protest influences the production of particular poetic forms in Trinidad and Jamaica. The class will move from early twentieth century writers like Claude McKay to the important contributions of later writers such as Kamau Brathwaite, Jamaica Kincaid, George Lamming, V.S. Naipaul, Sam Selvon, Olive Senior and Derek Walcott. We will examine the more recent innovations in form, as musical elements are introduced by writers such as Mikey Smith and Kwame Dawes.

Still others were born in places from which they never emigrated, and yet their narratives reveal some of the same questions raised in the work of those who did. All of them lived either on the fringe or with the uncertainty that was a condition of their lives, laboring under the stress of assimilation, displacement, or a threat to their survival. Who were these individuals, and what do their personal narratives offer about themselves, their communities, and their time? Did their dual participation in society contribute to an enriched or problematic identity? What did they create from their ambiguous or excluded status? We\u2019ll also look at the role memoir has played in Jewish life. Does it have a long tradition, or have Jews avoided presentations of the self? Where do memory and survival intersect? How does each writer see him or herself\u2014as a conveyor of individual or collective memory? To what extent is writing rescue of the past, and to what extent affirmation of a future?

It begins with the fraught colonial discourse on the relationship between art and economy, and the fear that industrial production would destroy indigenous craft and design. This instigated a colonial system of education, and the creation of museums, that taught both the European \u2018fine arts\u2019 of painting and sculpture, and the Indian \u2018applied arts\u2019 of craft and design in practice and in objects. The course further focuses on specific media as physical and intellectual conduits in the economy. We will pay particular attention to the explosive effect of the technologies of print and photography in colonial control and nationalist agitation. We will also examine the materiality of textiles, clay, wood, metal, stone, and food in their production, exhibition display, and cultural and political context. The course will conclude with contemporary artists\u2019 consideration of craft and the formation of national museums. In parallel to the focus on visual and material objects, we will read selections from primary sources on art and industry, such as George C. Birdwood\u2019sIndustrial Arts of India(1880),TheJournal of Indian Art and Industry, and Mahatma Gandhi\u2019sHind Swaraj(1909).",

This course focuses on the challenges and opportunities of the most current phase of globalization economies in MENA face that started with the oil boom of 2003. We investigate initially the prognostications of the Washington Consensus, particularly its central argument that the need for neo-liberal reform in the region would led to, and be reinforced, by political liberalization. Using institutional theories, we then discuss how a unique combination of historical legacies, the nature of resources, and financial crisis, led to a re-evaluation of development paradigms in MENA that increasingly included attention to good governance and human resource development. The case studies include distinct sets of countries across the region: the Arab republics, the MENA monarchies, and the Arab Gulf countries. The final section of the course looks at the interaction between national, regional, and global economies of the region.",

We think carefully about how to react to new bodies\u2014whether they are students arriving at our universities, migrant workers following job opportunities, or refugees fleeing across borders. We intuitively grasp that the movements of people can have wide-ranging consequences for the sending societies, receiving societies, and the migrants themselves. Yet somehow, there is a tendency to think about migration in the past in more simplistic terms. In this class, we will apply our nuanced ways of understanding modern mobility to the archaeological past. By addressing the motives, mechanisms, and outcomes of migration through the lens of material culture, we will see how archaeologists can situate past migrations at the forefront of social theory. Our primary focus will be on method and theory, rather than the details of any specific migration. Serious engagement with the weekly readings is necessary to begin tackling seemingly straightforward questions including: How are archaeologists dealing with migration? How aren\u2019t they? How should they? And how can they?",

What are the ideas, beliefs, or rituals that unite the world\u2019s diverse Muslim communities under the rubric of Islam? Conversely, what distinguishes Muslim beliefs and practices from one another in different times and places, and how might we interpret these distinctions in anthropological terms? Drawing on a rich and rapidly expanding body of research into one of the world\u2019s great faith traditions, this course introduces students to the study of Islam as both an historical tradition and a lived reality. Our course integrates anthropological approaches to understanding Islam with textual and social historical ones. The anthropological approach values the study of sacred texts and practices as they are locally understood throughout the world and in different historical contexts. This course focuses on Islam as practiced in the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, Africa, Central Asia, and in Europe and North America. It seeks to appreciate the contributions of religious leaders and activists as much as ordinary believers, showing the multiple ways in which Muslims throughout the world have contributed to the vitality of the Islamic tradition. Many different people and groups, including violent ones, claim to speak for Islam. This course suggests ways of re-thinking increasingly vocal debates concerning \u201cauthentic\u201d Islam and who speaks for it.",

We will explore ethnographic accounts of heterogeneous sites of language-in-use, and address issues such as language standardization, globalization, gender and race relations, subcultures, affect, political economy, etc. Students will learn not just about various sites of linguistic activity in and about Japan, but they will also learn how to situate the Japanese linguistic modernity in a crosscultural, comparative, historical perspective.",

We will seriously consider theories that posit mental illness as biological in origin, although the primary aim of this course is to complicate our understandings of mental health and illness using a constructivist approach. We will endeavor to unpack how women\u2019s experiences of mental illness emerge within specific, gendered social and historical contexts. Through this examination, we will grapple with crucial issues that feminists face in conceptualizing mental health and illness and the political nature of psychiatric knowledge.",

These include immigration, nationalism, modernity, revolution, war, and terrorism. Our texts will focus on the experience of individual countries, such as Egypt, Iraq, and Algeria, but we will also contextualize them with pan-regional trends.

We will examine case studies of satirical production, from the 18th century through the late 20th century, from the darkly comic prints of Hogarth and Daumier, to the overtly humorous and/or subversive gestures of Duchamp and Dada, Warhol and Pop Art, to the satire of gender roles and modern capitalism in Postmodernism. We will pay particular attention to the role of satire in modern art as it employed irony, parody, ridicule and exaggeration to attack social mores, political figures and the art world status quo. We will also explore the use of satire in film and TV, from the darkly comic (Charlie Chaplin) to the ridiculous (Stephen Colbert).

The Reformation brought into question the assumptions by which most Europeans had lived\u2014that the Church\u2019s teachings, personal good actions, and Christ\u2019s sacrifice could insure their salvation. Using the printing press and artworks, both sides presented their positions in propagandistic language that could be both bombastic and subtle.

The geographic focus of the course\u2013mostly the Muslim nations of the Arabian peninsula and North Africa\u2013is not meant to perpetuate the assumptions about this region as a monolithic geopolitical entity, nor to blindly label its production according to existing ethnic, religious or national categories. Against media stereotypes of the region, the artists studied in this course have made work that function as a critical platform for rethinking traditional identity formations and extending the space of cultural encounter across borders (territorial, political, linguistic). In many cases these artists may not be living and working in their country of birth but their ethnicity, religion or citizenship continues to inform both their own sense of identity and the terms of their art practice. Some of the topics to be discussed include: artistic responses to the Arab-Israeli conflict, representations of everyday life in times of war, the movement and obstruction of people, goods and information across borders, the rise of new art markets in the Middle East, the politics of gender and sexuality in the Arab world, and the of use archival documents to rethink the meaning of evidence, truth and testimony.",

In broader terms, this module explores the rapidly mutable audio-visual environments/interfaces of the digital age and their impact on social relations and cultural production. We will also examine the tensions between intimacy and distance, distraction and attention, and passivity and participation that characterize image consumption within the routines of contemporary technological culture. Finally, this module offers a historical and political framework for understanding contemporary art\u2019s seeming disavowal of the digital and the expanding non-stop processes of twenty-first-century capitalism that underpin it. At the same time, we will assess some of emancipatory possibilities opened by the accessibility and affordability of digital cameras, editing software and mobile devices.

The course consists largely of four themes: the Silk Road and the Arts, the Pottery Stories, the Jesuits and the Arts, and Asian Arts in Europe. The class starts with the Silk Road, the world\u2019s first great superhighway that from ancient times linked East Asia to the Mediterranean World across Central Asia, and examines how ideas, art, and religions traveled and were transformed through their journey. The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have \u201cthe Pottery War\u201d and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters\u2019 on European subject matter with a European medium. The last theme, Asian art in Europe, scrutinizes the Western reception of Asian subjects, motifs, designs, and aesthetic values, and their appropriation for artistic productions. European interpretation (or imitation) of Chinese arts, so calledChinoiseries, and the Japanese influence on European art, known asJaponism,will be closely examined. Through lectures, readings, and films, we will explore the historical and artistic links between East and West and some selected art associated with those routes.This course requires no previous experience, but is intended for those who like interdisciplinary approaches to art and culture. No previous coursework is required.",

The concerns and styles of the Late Gothic are present, mixing with new forms of technology, such as printing or the perfection of oil painting techniques. The weakened grip of the Church contributes to the emerging emphasis on the individual that characterizes Early Modern art. The fifteenth century sees the rise of secular art, the concept of objective realism, the development of panel painting, the commercialization of prints, and the beginnings of independent portraiture. My goal is to give you the knowledge and skills that will enable you to understand and appreciate the nuances and complexity in fifteenth-century artworks wherever you encounter them. In addition to the mastery of scholarly materials, you will work on reading visual culture, practicing your writing skills and perfecting your oral communication. \u00a0 \u00a0 Our focus will be on reception, context and invention.",

During this time, the Italian peninsula was a hotbed of revolutionary ideas about how architecture could shape and be shaped by the human will. In fact, the Renaissance in Italy saw the emergence of a new type of architecture, which took its cue from the needs, activities, and ambitions of humans. Building practices and styles that were initially based on medieval models gradually evolved in light of the self-conscious discovery and consequent reinterpretation of classical antiquity. The chronological presentation of the material is interspersed with lectures that present some of the broad themes of the course (humanism, the inspirational role of ancient and medieval buildings, living conditions and styles, the profession of the architect, etc.). Accordingly, lectures and textbook readings will focus on the major thinkers, designers, and builders of the period as well as on the economic, political, and religious forces that were at play in the formation of ambitious and beautiful buildings that placed humankind as its center.",

The first third of the course will focus on the colonial discourse of art and economy, and the fear that industrial production would destroy indigenous craft and design. This instigated a colonial system of education, and the creation of museums, that taught both the European \u2018fine arts\u2019 of painting and sculpture, and the Indian \u2018applied arts\u2019 of craft and design in practice and in objects. The second third of the course will attend to specific media as physical and intellectual conduits in the economy. We will discuss the explosive effect of the technologies of print and photography in colonial control and nationalist agitation. We will also examine the materiality of textiles, clay, wood, metal, plastic, paper, and food in their production, exhibition display, and cultural and political context. The last third of the course will focus on modern artists\u2019 considerations of art and craft, the formation of national museums, and the contemporary art market.

Students will have an opportunity to think critically about how an art historical canon is constructed and how it might evolve.

During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, major artists and architects like Leonardo da Vinci participated in a radical experiment that transformed how urban spaces were designed, represented, and built. The Renaissance ideal city was invented as a utopia, featuring straight processional avenues, a rigid street plan, and monumental sculptures inserted into public squares like props on a stage. We will consider three variations on the Renaissance ideal city, both in Italy and neighboring regions: fictional cities like the star-shaped Sforzinda (1465) that were imagined in sketchbooks, paintings, and the pages of printed books; new cities and towns that were built from the ground up according to ideal models of urban planning, such as Pienza (1459) and Palmanova (1593); and the demolition and reconstruction of entire neighborhoods in existing metropolises like Palermo and Rome. Throughout, we will question how Renaissance architects exploited the basic infrastructure of daily life \u2013\u00a0roads, gates, walls, squares, and even sewage systems \u2013 to perfect their environments. What role did the artistic principles of harmony, proportion, and perspective play in the design or depiction of ideal cities?

Students will learn how to identify and analyze the key genres and styles of 19th century American art, including portraiture, photography, ledger drawing, monuments, and landscape, history, and genre painting. They will consider how character and class are constructed through the portrait; how the claims of settler nationalism are naturalized through landscape; how anxieties about racial emancipation, immigration, and gender advancement are managed through images of the \u201cpeople;\u201d how war both consolidated and radically challenged prevailing conceptions of American identity; and how minoritized populations challenged the dominant construction of \u201cAmerica\u201d throughout this period.

In this course we will place artists like Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco and Frida Kahlo within a broader visual cultural context that includes not only mural art and painting, but also sculpture, architecture, printmaking, photography, installation, film, and performance.

It\u2019s been nearly three years since Edward Snowden leaked documents detailing sweeping surveillance programs carried out by the U.S. National Security Agency. Since that time, the former government contractor has been alternately branded a hero and a traitor. A steady drip of disclosures from the leaked materials has fueled a critical debate over privacy, civil liberties, and national security. This seminar considers the strategies and tactics developed in the aftermath of 9/11 that have come to be known as the \u201cwar on terror\u201d: ground wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere; torture; mass and warrantless surveillance; and the use of drones in what officials call \u201ctargeted killing.\u201d The question of who possesses what data, how its processed, and how this changes the economic power structure and social concepts of the private sphere, knowledge, and responsibility is becoming more and more urgent. In focusing on data and communications streams in global networks, this course addresses the highly complex and invisible forms of political/economic power and the role that images play within a world of \u201ctotal surveillance.\u201d Every U.S. citizen is part of the surveillance state. This course asks students to recognize and critically confront that (often unknowing) participation. We will draw on the work of artists, filmmakers, and critics such as: Jacob Appelbaum, Gilles Deleuze, Cory Doctorow, Laura Poitras, Hito Steyerl, Ai Weiwei, Trevor Paglen, Jill Majid, Kate Crawford.",

In addition, we will consider specialization of form and function to the diverse ecology of vertebrates as well as the manner in which very different taxa cope with similar habitats and environmental demands. In so doing, we will draw on evolutionary principles such as adaptation, convergent and parallel evolution and evolutionary constraints.

Yet evidence for cooperation is ubiquitous in biology, b0th across taxa (from bacteria to humans) and across hierarchical levels of biological organization (from genes to cells to multi-cellular organisms to societies). This course will explore how and why cooperation evolves, with the goal of understanding general ecological and evolutionary principles, especially the conditions under which organisms work together and help one another despite competition and conflicting interests. A central focus of the course will be on social interactions among unrelated individuals, particularly how cooperation co-evolves with a form of communication known as 'gossip'-in which third parties are spoken about behind their backs. The course will explore when and why gossip has a positive versus negative impact on cooperation. Students will learn key experimental studies of cooperation and communication (both in nonhumans and humans) and will also be exposed to the conceptual, mathematical, and computational models that predict when cooperation and gossip will be evolutionarily favored. In-class laboratories (involving experimental cooperation-gossip games as well as analyses of conversations) will give students direct empirical exposure to the concepts covered in class.",

Students are challenged to know, understand and appreciate the diversity of form and function in organisms, and the interactions that generate the often-spectacular patterns they see in the field. Habitats in Costa Rica include lowland rain forest, cloud forest, dry forest, montane forest, alpine paramo, streams and wetlands. The schedule is full, including fieldwork, laboratories, lectures and discussions, with emphasis on original research, mostly in small groups of 2-3. Faculty and advanced graduate TAs share field accommodations with students, and are in continuous contact as mentors, day and evening, throughout the program. Students master field and analytical methods (including hypothesis testing, statistical and software skills) for observational and experimental research. We pursue a great variety of research topics, including plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions, processes driving coral reef structure (and coral reef decline), determinants of species distributions, animal behavior, and conservation ecology. Students practice the classic scientific approach: making observations, asking testable questions, generating hypotheses, developing experimental protocols, collecting data, making statistical inferences, writing scientific papers, and presenting seminars. Research papers are published in an annual book. Accommodations are at field stations in Costa Rica, and at a marine laboratory in the Caribbean.",

In fact, the very question of \u201cwhat is a gene?\u201d is even being reconsidered, as the fundamental unit of genomic organization appears not to be the classical DNA-based \u201cgene\u201d but instead is the RNA-based transcript.\u00a0 In this course we will explore these issues and more through lectures, literature discussions, student-led presentations, and student writing assignments.",

We will explore love in its various forms \u2013 devotion, lust, physical sexuality, friendship, and familial bonds \u2013 by looking at the central authors and genres of the Latin literary tradition (in English translation).

In Rome, the emergence of the state, including thedevelopment of the concept of the citizen, coincided with the development of the slave society.African slavery in Brazil was introduced soon after the establishment of the colonial governmentand drew heavily from classical legal definitions. In this course we compare the social andpolitical structures of these two slave systems (high art, popular culture, institutions). Weexamine how each slave society was legitimated, perpetuated-and ultimately challenged.Specific topics include: the construction of the slave and the emergence of racializing discourse,the slave trade and the commodification of the body, trickster narratives, modern theories ofpower and domination, resistance and rebellion, and the problem of freedom for previouslydominated peoples. Through comparison, students will not only become aware of the similaritiesbetween these two slave societies, but will also be better equipped to evaluate their uniquequalities and particular achievements.",

Such sites as Baalbek, Petra, Dura-Europos, Palmyra, Roman Egypt, Tripolitania, Tunisia and Algeria, Constantinian Jerusalem, Trier, Spalato, etc., may be included. May be taken in partial fulfillment of the major in Art History.",

Do we aim to make the text as accessible and familiar to modern readers as it might have been to its original audience? Do we aim to let modern readers feel the distance between themselves and the culture and language of the original? Do we aim primarily to respect the integrity of the text's linguistic, cultural and aesthetic choices, or do we aim primarily at \"bringing it into the twenty-first century\"?\u00a0\u00a0 We will study different theoretical approaches to these questions and different renderings of old texts; we will interview experienced scholars and translators, from Dartmouth and elsewhere, who have translated from a variety of literary traditions. All students will try their hand at translating, in short exercises and a final project. Texts to be studied may include Beowulf; the Tale of Genji; selections from the Bible; Sophocles'Antigone; the Bhagavad Gita; and lyric poetry from various traditions.Prerequisite: Fulfillment of the Dartmouth language requirement (in any language) or equivalent competence in at least one language other than English. The course may be taken as a follow-on toCOLT 19, but can also be taken independently.",

        "description": "Ever since the exclusion of poets from Plato\u2019s Republic, literature has often been accused of being dangerous and useless to society. Law, on the other hand, with all of its sovereign splendor and control over society, is considered to work at the behest of thestatus quo. Although sharing the same medium (the written text), law and literature seem to be worlds apart. This class will probe the intricate relationship of law and literature, both the representation of the lawinliterature (as inOedipus,Michael Kohlhaas,Billy Budd,In the Penal Colony,The Trial) and how law itself in its rhetoric and theatricality is a kind of literature (particularly the courtroom drama): in other words, lawasliterature. Whether it be theUS Constitution, theDeclaration of Independence,The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the testimony and court documents in the Eichmann Trial (see Arendt), or certain major Supreme Court decisions, the law cannot escape its figurative, theatrical, political and even criminal dimension. The conflicted and yet close relation of law and literature in its various permutations lies at the heart of this class. While representation of trials in literature may reflect self-consciously upon the political and legal thrust of the literary text, trials of literary works question the literature\u2019s status as legitimate object of scholarly inquiry. What are the accusations to which literary studies have had to answer? Is the law confined to the prohibiting, limiting and controlling part in this relationship while literature can operate as the transgressor of norms or as the playground for textual and societal experiments? The class will thus have to consider theinherent excess (or lawlessness) within the law itselfwhile at the same time addressingliterature\u2019s normative and disciplining effects.",

The course will also trace the pervasive presence of noir and its continuing appeal for artists and audiences throughout the world.

Through readings representing a range of psychoana\u00adlytic and literary traditions, we will examine the connections that can be made between psy\u00adchic structures and literary structures, between the language of the mind and the emotions and the language of the literary, cultural or cinematic text.What is the relationship between \u201cliterary\u201d works and the theoretical and clinical writings of psychoanalysis? How do they inform one another? This large question will be examined through readings of essays and case histories by theorists such as Freud, Lacan, Kristeva, Butler,\u00a0 Phillips, Bersani and Zizek. The course will focus on the theme of the family romance and its relationship to the question of gender in works by authors such as Sophocles, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Kafka, Woolf, Mann, Proust, Duras, and Almadovar.",

We shall now learn how to prove that O(n log n) is the best we can hope to do: in other words, (n log n) is alower boundon the number of comparisons required to sort.During the course we shall survey lower bound results from a wide range of areas in Computer Science. Broadly, we shall study decision trees, Boolean circuits, and communication protocols. We shall consider simple looking problems from each of these areas but, as we shall learn, even innocent looking lower bound results can be quite a challenge to prove.Proving lower bounds requires a puzzle-solving bent of mind rather than extensive knowledge of Algorithms; this course will involve quite different ways of thinking than CS 31.

This course will explore the nature and properties of soils and examine how these processes occur in natural and human-influenced soils, and identify reasonable limits on what can influence the sustainable utilization of soils as a resource. We will begin by developing an understanding of the geologic, biologic, and chemical processes that lead to soil formation and the development of specific soil properties. The second portion of the course will examine the relationship between soils and underlying bedrock and overlying vegetation and the role of soils in ecosystems. The final section of the course will examine the situations in which soils are used to reduce the impact of human activities and the way in which humans can reduce their impact on soils: the importance of soils in septic tanks and leach fields; the use of soils as solid waste landfill caps and liners; the use of soils in the storage of hazardous wastes; and the conservation and management of soils.",

We explore how glaciers work, and how they interact with the climate system. We investigate how ice behaves from the molecular scale to the continental scale and compare and contrast this behavior to that of snowpacks. The practical skills and techniques used by glaciologists to study glaciers and ice sheets are considered along with transferable skills in advanced quantitative data analysis, including time series analysis and computational modeling of physical processes, with emphasis on practical application to real data.",

        "description": "F. O. Matthiessen coined the term \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d in his groundbreaking book,The American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman(1941). At the outset of the nineteenth century American writers struggled with a sense of cultural inferiority and artistic belatedness. The \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d demarcates a period as well as a cultural movement marked by intense literary activity between the 1830s and 1860s that aimed at the formation of a distinctivelyAmericanliterature. Matthiessen restricted the American Renaissance to the years between 1850 and 1855, an \u201cextraordinarily concentrated moment of literary expression\u201d (vii) that saw the publication of Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019sThe Scarlet Letter,House of the Seven Gables, andThe Blithedale Romance; Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019sRepresentative Men; Herman Melville\u2019sMoby-Dick; Henry David Thoreau\u2019sWalden; and Walt Whitman\u2019sLeaves of Grass. In the years since the publication of Matthiessen\u2019s important work, teachers and scholars in American literature have extended the American Renaissance\u2019s chronological provenance at least as far back as the anti-slavery debates in the 1830s and as far forward as the termination of the Civil War. In the past several decades, Matthiessen\u2019s argument has been challenged for its exaggeration of the originality of his coterie of male authors, for the exclusion of women and African-American and popular authors from his account of the United States during a period of remarkable social and cultural transformation, and for its seemingly uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of American exceptionalism. In light of these criticisms, scholars have added Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, Margaret Fuller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mark Twain (among others) to Matthiessen\u2019s American Renaissance pantheon.",

This richly diverse literature will be tracked through the cultural and political history of South Africa with primary emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries before and after the fall of Apartheid. Confrontation between black militancy and white oppression characterizes much writing and social interaction in South Africa before the fall of Apartheid, but complex forms of multi-ethnic coexistence and interchange have also been evident since the first white settlement of the country in 1652. Recent work by J.M. Coetzee and Zakes Mda among others explores the difficult, unmapped terrain of post-Apartheid South Africa. Works by the following writers may be included in the course: Olive Schreiner, Solomon Plaatje, Bessie Head, Nadine Gordimer, Zoe Wicomb, Alan Paton, J.M Coetzee, Njabulo Ndebele, Athol Fugard, Nelson Mandela.",

In England, one of the few countries to escape widespread violence, 1848 was a year of rampant publication. The texts published in the UK, ranging from Marx and Engels\u2019The Communist Manifestoto Gothic novels and Pre-Raphaelite poems, do not always seem obviously radical or even similar to one another in theme and mood. Are these texts in fact revolutionary? Are any of the texts politically or socially conservative, or do they represent conservative characters or perspectives? Do they take revolutionary forms or structures? To what extent are the texts participating in the same public sphere and historical moment? In responding to these questions, this colloquium will read literary texts (by Gaskell, Dickens, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Browning, and Tennyson) alongside artistic and political manifestos, popular political poetry, visual images, scientific and critical prose, and contemporary literary criticism (feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, poststructuralist).

And while no one reads Stevens for his \u201cbric-a-brac\u201d many readers come to Frost for his subjects, which have been misunderstood and sentimentalized over time. It is important to remember, reading him now, that Frost\u2019s New England was no Transcendental retreat, and no rural paradise; poor, depopulated by western expansion on the one hand, and the industrialization of mill towns on the other, it was a landscape of failed and abandoned farmsteads, old people and misfits left to fend on their own, worn-out fields, harsh climate, intellectually moribund and spiritually enervated. Frost came to this \u201csubject\u201d without illusions or bitterness and it is through this subject that we will begin to rethink his poetics and ideas.

Why has walking long been regarded as a vehicle for thought and discourse: a privileged mechanism of knowledge production? Is there a difference between a country walk and a city walk? What is the relationship between walking and time, walking and place? Why should walking have emerged, in certain works of contemporary literature, as a principled rejection of mechanization, modernity, and the capitalist mode of production? And what does walking mean for those who cannot walk? To address these questions, students will read texts by such practitioners and theorists of walking as Thoreau, Walter Benjamin, W. G. Sebald, Rebecca Solnit, Simon Armitage, Robert MacFarlane, Geoff Nicholson, and others.

        "description": "From Arthur and Merlin to prophecy, poetry, and song, the literatures of medieval England drew heavily on the lively, imaginative, and sophisticated traditions of their Celtic neighbors, their musical styles and the particular aesthetic they brought to their poetry and narrative.\u00a0\u00a0 In this course we will study some pairings of connected Celtic and English/Anglo-Norman texts, as well as contemporary writing about the Celtic connection. The politics of these exchanges are not easy. There were wars and border skirmishes; the Norman and Angevin kings of England sought to subdue the Celtic kingdoms and extend their political influence by diplomacy, coercion and conquest, creating a dynamic that is in some ways parallel to, but also interestingly different from a modern Colonial/Postcolonial situation.\u00a0 Readings may include early Arthurian material;Diarmaidand Grainneand the Anglo-French Tristan romances; Geoffrey of Monmouth'sLife of Merlinand Merlinesque prophecies; the WelshMabinogi; lais by Marie de France and other writers; the borderland romance \"Fulk Fitz Warren\"; the anecdotes, satires and short romances of Walter Map; Gerald of Wales's ethnographic descriptions/ travelogues of Wales and Ireland.\u00a0 All non-English texts will be read in translation, although students with some knowledge of French, Latin, or a Celtic language may wish to explore some readings in the original. Enrollment limited to 12.",

Just a year before, though, James Agee and Walker Evans -- a journalist and photographer -- had publishedLet Us Now Praise Famous Men, a vast book, indeed, sprawling in its feverish devotion to the experimentation Agee and Evans believed necessary to even come close to telling a true story. Agee and Evans wanted it to be an object as much as a book, a challenge to literary culture; whatever it was, it wasn't \"sub\" anything. In this course we'll use the question of just what Agee's and Evan's combination of pictures and words might be as the heart of our exploration of the documentary sphere as encountered through the conjunction of text and image. In the first half of the course, we\u2019ll be guided by critical thinkers as we look at creative works and write our own critical essays; in the second, we\u2019ll be guided by creative work as we attempt our own even while we continue our conversations with more contemporary critical thinkers.

Using that question \u2014 a question that, in its very persistence, already crystalizes all that is most troubling, provocative, and intriguing about the Freudian text \u2014 students in this class will read Freud for his enduring value as the inventor, in psychoanalysis, of one of modernity\u2019s most disturbing art forms, as an influential theorist of figuration and representation, as a fearless inquirer into the mysteries of gender and sexuality, and as a speculative thinker who continues to have a hold on our imagination precisely because he could never quite come to grips with all that had a hold on his imagination.

To facilitate that understanding, students will rely on the texts collected inBiopolitics: A Reader, supplemented by Esposito\u2019sTerms of the Politicaland Melinda Cooper\u2019sLife as Surplus.

We will also interrogate how appeals to cruelty underwrite various rights discourses, including debates on the death penalty, human and animal rights, and various international treatises that put a limit on the violence of war. Authors will include: Marquis de Sade, Antonin Artaud, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. Films might include:Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom(Dir. Pasolini),The Piano Teacher(Dir. Haneke),andAntichrist(Dir. von Trier).",

Agriculture and land management has increased soil erosion around the world, potentially influencing the history and fate of civilizations. In the modern era, this use is not sustainable; the physical and chemical degradation of soils far outpaces soil production. This course will explore the nature and properties of soils and examine how these processes occur in natural and human-influenced soils, and identify reasonable limits on what can influence the sustainable utilization of soils as a resource. We will begin by developing an understanding of the geologic, biologic, and chemical processes that lead to soil formation and the development of specific soil properties. The second portion of the course will examine the relationship between soils and underlying bedrock and overlying vegetation and the role of soils in ecosystems. The final section of the course will examine the situations in which soils are used to reduce the impact of human activities and the way in which humans can reduce their impact on soils: the importance of soils in septic tanks and leach fields; the use of soils as solid waste landfill caps and liners; the use of soils in the storage of hazardous wastes; and the conservation and management of soils.",

In this course, we will examine noir in relation to its many contexts: the hard-boiled fiction of Chandler and Hammett; the experience of dislocation and alienation that reflect the exile status of many central-European professionals who worked in the US film industry in the 1940s; and Hollywood blacklisting and censorship during the anti-Communist witch hunt. The course will also trace the pervasive presence of noir and its continuing appeal for artists and audiences throughout the world. Because of its artistic and political complexity, noir is a key term for the study of US postwar cultural history: noir narratives revolve around questions of racial and national identity, around the postwar crisis of masculinity, and the convergence of modernism and mass culture.",

We will study miscreants who single-mindedly pursue their destructive goals. By examining how literature and music represent misogyny, we will pay particular attention to what constitutes \u201cbad\u201d behavior, to what initiates such behavior, and to the moral and social implications of such behavior. At the same time, we will discuss how the \u201cgood\u201d aesthetics of \u201cbad\u201d (the way in which aesthetic beauty) is made from the raw materials of social and psychological malefaction. These broader questions will help frame our thematic investigation of misbehavior, with discussions on vices such as rakishness, hubris, greed and narcissism. We will focus on how literary and musical genres portray these vices, and then take note of how vices attain an ambiguous meaning within the social and moral systems of these works.",

The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.",

It draws from a broad array of cases to illustrate the most important issues at stake in current electoral reforms around the world, and here in the United States.",

The first part of this course covers this historical emergence of middle eastern regimes since the early 1950s.In each country--Libya, Tunisia,Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria--elites have responded differently to the uprising, depending in part on the institutional repertoire each country possessed. As yet, it is unclear what the different trajectories of each country's period of upheaval will be, but they all share important common political elements and developments: transitional arrangements as the first phase of contestation comes to an end, proposed elections leading to constitution-making processes and to referendums that are meant to introduce--or re-introduce--forms of constitutional government.In order to understand this protracted process we will study the mechanics of transition through a comparative case-study approach in particularly Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, and Bahrain. Peripherally we also study the question of why the Arab Gulf states have been relatively immune from popular uprisings, and we incorporate in our discussion as well the role international actors (the United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union, the European Union) have played in the unfolding of the uprisings and beyond.",

Some hold that morality is intensely demanding, and asks us to overcome the natural concern for ourselves and those close to us. Others argue that the moral life is simple and relatively easy to comply with. Are morally excellent people happier-or is happiness beside the point of morality. Does a political community that enshrines the \"pursuit of happiness\" as among its foundational goals need to take a concern with the moral character of citizens? These questions will be investigated through readings that move between the history of moral and political thought (Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill) and cases and questions drawn from contemporary life.",

It is more difficult to pass legislation under divided government than when the same party controls Congress and the presidency. ... In this course, we will examine many such common claims (\"myths\") about politics. Specifically, we will review empirical evidence for each claim and discuss whether each myth can be busted, plausible, or confirmed. We will also discuss how to devise our own tests for renewed scrutiny using statistical data and methods.",

News media usage of the phrase \"world public opinion\" or \"global public opinion,\" as well as scholarly research about it, dramatically increased during the last decade. But has global public opinion actually played an important role in international affairs? What are the attitudes of citizens around the world towards some crucial global issues that require international cooperation? Do their attitudes substantially affect states' ability to cooperate to address such issues? In this course, by examining these questions through a variety of assignments (writing a short literature review, making a \"news story\" video, working on a data visualization project, etc.), students will learn important theories and empirical findings on global public opinion. The topics covered include international institutions and human rights, the environment and climate change, nuclear energy, happiness, trust and social capital, global economy, war and peace, terrorism, anti-Americanism, U.S. foreign policy and soft power, soft power competition in Asia, the rise of China, immigration, and foreign aid.",

The answer is found not in every sort of utterance, but in a distinctive kind of speech\u2014political speech. Political speech is believed to distinctly reveal (and betray) our freedom and dignity.

Given this blindness, it comes as no surprise that we would be living in times that do not pay enough attention to the humanities or to the aesthetic realm for they seem too \"removed\" from the day to day facts of \"reality.\" But let's think again. Who bears witness to the suffering and inequalities around us, to the walls that have been relentlessly erected to keep us all in place? Writers, filmmakers, documentarians, photographers, poets, individuals, who make \"energy\" (intellectual energy) usable in different places and contexts (Hutcheon). This course will cross disciplinary boundaries and follow the \"comparative method\" scrupulously. We will be reading literature with care and learning how to read literarily\u2014with intensive textual scrutiny, defiance, and metatheoretical awareness (Saussy)\u2014a wide array of theoretical and filmic texts. Our goal will be to travel from the theoretical to the particular and vice-versa, from the literary and filmic stories to the suprapersonal, to the wider polity and back to the personal, for these texts share a passion for change through recognizing our shared vulnerability and humanity. With varying degrees of insight, these texts bear witness to how the experience of crisis and regeneration is also a gendered one.",

Who were these individuals, and what do their personal narratives offer about themselves, their communities, and their time? Did their dual participation in society contribute to an enriched or problematic identity? What did they create from their ambiguous or excluded status? We\u2019ll also look at the role memoir has played in Jewish life. Does it have a long tradition, or have Jews avoided presentations of the self? Where do memory and survival intersect? How does each writer see him or herself\u2014as a conveyor of individual or collective memory? To what extent is writing rescue of the past, and to what extent affirmation of a future?

Who were these individuals, and what do their personal narratives offer about themselves, their communities, and their time? Did their dual participation in society contribute to an enriched or problematic identity? What did they create from their ambiguous or excluded status?

How does each writer see him or herself\u2014as a conveyor of individual or collective memory? To what extent is writing rescue of the past, and to what extent affirmation of a future?

After a brief survey of the physical and cultural geography of the region, the course examines the history of selected countries to highlight the way European conquest and colonialism have molded Latin American institutions and attitudes. The course then turns to particular case studies of contemporary life and society to analyze the ongoing problems of ethnicity, inequality, and political repression engendered by the region's colonial past. Finally, the course draws on these historical and anthropological understandings to assess recent economic, social, and political developments in Latin America. By juxtaposing historical realities with their living consequences, the course presents a multi-disciplinary perspective on the nature, dynamics-and future prospects-of the many peoples who inhabit this vast and diverse continent.",

This course examines slave systems in the ancient and modern worlds comparatively, focusing on Rome and Brazil. In Rome, the emergence of the state, including the development of the concept of the citizen, coincided with the development of the slave society. African slavery in Brazil was introduced soon after the establishment of the colonial government and drew heavily from classical legal definitions. In this course we compare the social and political structures of these two slave systems (high art, popular culture, institutions). We examine how each slave society was legitimated, perpetuated\u2014and ultimately challenged. Specific topics include: the construction of the slave and the emergence of racializing discourse, the slave trade and the commodification of the body, trickster narratives, modern theories of power and domination, resistance and rebellion, and the problem of freedom for previously dominated peoples. Through comparison, students will not only become aware of the similarities and differences between these two slave societies, but will also be better equipped to evaluate slavery as a discourse of power that facilitates a system of domination.",

How have forms of political representation changed over the past century? How does state policy affect the ability of groups to mobilize and press for demands?

We will study the ways in which performance has been used as a forum that not only raises political, social, and cultural consciousness, but also interrupts daily life and rehearses notions of community in the 20th and 21st centuries. Theoretical articles on performance and activism will serve to complement the varied modes of performance studied and explicate how they have sparked civic dialogue and social change. We will pay special attention to the ways Latin American and Latino activist practitioners have engaged civil society as well as government and corporate structures through their praxis. Throughout the term, we will revisit the questions: why be an activist, where, how and when; and how can performance be placed at the service of activism. Class discussions and activities will underscore the critical interconnection between theory and practice (praxis). In addition to studying the power of performance as a tool for activism students will have the opportunity to experience hands-on performance techniques that can be used to engage social and political issues of concern to the class. Working in groups, students will take a stance on one of these issues before creating a public intervention.\u00a0These interventions might draw from street/guerilla theater, installation art, invisible theater, performance art, dance, protest poetry, photography, muralism, or digitally mediated performance. This course is open to all students with or without experience in the arts.",

Moreover, most features of the natural world are probabilistic and frequently best described by probability models, such as the firing of neurons in the brain or the timing of earthquakes. Both are also central to all problems in statistics. This course will explore the application of linear algebra and probability to problems across the sciences.

We will explore the complicated ways that the literary Indian has served to both authenticate and trouble the nation's founding narratives and desires, and more recently, to stand as a mythical antidote to postmodern crises of value, economics, ecology, and spirituality.

For Indigenous peoples, the resurgence of traditional Indigenous laws and their accompanying legal\u00a0 structures serves as an important marker of indigenous self-determination and nation (re)building. At the same time, these developments challenge the long-standing hegemony of the nation-state, particularly the centrality of the state's legal system and the presumption that the state is the sole author and arbiter of law. The resurgence of Indigenous law and legal systems, in short, tests the limits of legal pluralism, the notion that two or more legal systems can co-exist peacefully in shared territories.

He got a crash course in Indian diplomacy at age twenty-one and his mishandling of Indian allies sparked the French and Indian War. He participated in two expeditions against Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh) and defended the Virginia frontier against Indian attacks.

Technological innovations such as social media have made it possible to communicate instantaneously with hundreds of millions of people around the world and have, for purposes of regulating speech, rendered national boundaries virtually irrelevant. There is now an urgent need to determine how to assess and protect the values of free speech in this global context. Questions we will discuss include: Is there a universal human right to freedom of expression? If so, what is the philosophical basis for it? What are its limits? Does it protect racist hate speech as well as political dissent? How should the different free speech regimes currently in effect in different countries be reconciled in cases of conflict?",

This course will explore the hypothesis that all these modes of human behavior and cognition share a common root cause in our brains. We will focus in particular on the human capacity to imagine. We can, for example, construct a representation of a thing, say an airplane, or an event, say a planned party, and then go about making real that which we imagined. How is this capacity to imagine and creatively plan realized in the brain? Where did it first appear in the human lineage? What is the relationship of imagining to other important capacities, such as attention, volition, consciousness, planning and executive control? The goal of this course is to try to answer such questions by reading empirical and theoretical papers and chapters that try to account for what it is that makes the human mind human, by looking at distinctive aspects of processing in the human brain.",

We examine changes in how community bonds are formed in light of globalization and new technology. We review concerns about the loss of community and connection, and about the barriers to access and advancement faced by those with less social capital.

Artistic disciplines during the Soviet period were firmly entrenched within cultural industries that featured union memberships, the means to control production, distribution, and exhibition. Nonetheless, what was popular throughout Russo-Soviet history did not always emanate from state guided channels. How do we account for what we perceive as \u201canomalies\u201d in Russian popular culture: why did people listen to American jazz music under Stalin? Why were Bollywood films more popular than Soviet comedies? Why were Brazilian and Mexican telenovelas standard viewing in Soviet homes? How did the presence of foreign texts relate to the multi-ethnic makeup on the Soviet Union? How were founding mythologies of the nation encoded/rejected in domestic texts? \u00a0 While popular culture encompasses a multitude of media, special attention will be paid to trends in music and cinema, offering students a comprehensive, historical arc of each medium\u2019s development in Russia. The course will seek to establish a working definition of what we actually mean by \u201cRussian popular culture.\u201d Firstly, how do we differentiate between categorizations of mass culture versus popular culture? Secondly, we will challenge the notion of national culture when referring to the terms \u201cRussian\u201d and \u201cSoviet\u201d culture throughout the semester. Each unit is organized around the construct of \u201csvoi\u201d (\u201cours\u201d) vs. \u201cchuzhoi\u201d (\u201ctheirs\u201d), offering the class a point of comparison for how domestically produced culture often rivaled official foreign imports and blackmarket, unofficial distributed products. We will also explore larger, universal questions that revolve around top-bottom and bottom-up models of how popular culture operates. What does popular culture mean in the capitalist market context, and how might that definition change under socialism?",

The modernist schools and movements-symbolism, futurism, acmeism, imagism, and suprematism-were terminated in the 1930s by Stalin. Since then, despite decades of censorship and material hardship, Russian writers have continued to produce one of the world's greatest literatures. Readings will include Bulgakov'sThe Master and Margarita, Solzhenitsyn'sOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, works by such authors as Chekhov and Pasternak, and samples from the radical avant-garde.

This course examines his major novels, with particular emphasis on the artistic expression of his philosophical views. Those views will be examined in the context of Russian intellectual and literary history. Readings include \"Notes from Underground,\"Crime and Punishment,The Idiot,Demons, andThe Brothers Karamazov.

As he himself put the problem, \u2018Is there any meaning in my life which the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy?\u2019 In his quest for bulwarks against that fear, he studied the great philosophers and he examined closely the value system of the peasants. He found temporary relief in war and in marriage, but the definitive solution always eluded him. The evolution of this theme, and the formal devices by which Tolstoy expressed it in his prose, will be traced in the major novels,War and PeaceandAnna Karenina. The course will conclude with a brief examination of the prose that Tolstoy produced after his conversion. Taught in English. Open to all classes.",

To what degree are Western psychological theories and models relevant to non-Western cultures? What are the uses of madness from a social, political, and literary point of view?

These cases largely differ from one another, but have in common their opposition to inequality and readiness to struggle against it. The course will focus on the comparison of protest movements and the political processes each case provoked, using theories of social movements and political sociology, and analyzing the economic, social and political context before the protests sparked and the after movements' peaks. We will analyze and discuss in class the Occupy Wall Street movement and the political process it provoked in the US. Each student will chose an international case for comparison, presenting it in class and writing a research paper of their own as a final essay. Students will work in teams of two for their presentations and final research paper.",

This capstone seminar will explore current substantive and theoretical expressions of the sociological imagination for providing critical assistance in understanding some of the major social issues of our time.

With growing skepticism, there was talk of the death of utopias\u2026 just as there was talk of the death of the novel. Undaunted and unfazed by such apocalyptic talk, this course will track down and explore the utopian in its multiple forms and manifestations. We will take as a theoretical point of departure Ernst Bloch\u2019s fundamental distinction between classic narrative utopian paradigms such as More\u2019s Utopia and the ever changing field of the utopian and its multiple manifestations \u2014Bloch\u2019s electricity\u2014as we map out the creative movement of utopian thought. Beginning with the Avant-garde movements we will discuss new utopian paradigms as they intersect with artistic, literary and political discourses, exploring and displaying new visions of a better world for a better humankind. Materials will include Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Hopscotch, Fern\u00e1ndez Mallo\u2019s Nocilla trilogy as well as avant-garde painting, surrealist writings, experimental novels, political manifestoes, technological game changers and a fascinating journey into the new alternative utopian spaces opened up by a new frontier: the internet",

Instead of offering ways to enhance persuasion, inoculation offers resistance to persuasion. We will trace inoculation's development; reconsider some of its assumptions; explore its application in contexts of health, politics, and marketing; and discuss ethics of resistance-based message strategies. Writing and speaking projects will guide our consideration and analysis of this underexplored dimension of rhetoric. Limited enrollment. No prior speaking experience is necessary.",

Although it is an introduction to the use of voice in the theater, it is in no way limited to the actor. A specific progression of exercises will be presented to facilitate freeing the body of tensions, discovering the natural breath, releasing vibrations of sound from the body, and opening the channel for sound (throat, jaw, tongue). Resonance, vocal freedom, and articulation will also be explored. Techniques for accessing emotional and psychological truth will be practiced as fundamental to the actor's creative process. A groundwork will be laid for physical and vocal presence. Each student will be responsible for the development and practice of a vocal warm-up. A variety of speaking assignments will be made to develop confidence, presence and emotional expressivity. Text materials utilized will emerge from self-scripted autobiographical storytelling. A strong commitment to the work is necessary to explore what it means to find one's voice. Do not pre-register for this course: registration is invalid without permission from the instructor. To enroll in this course you must first interview with the instructor. Interviews are conducted on the first day of classes. A sign-up sheet for interviews will be posted in Shakespeare Alley the day before classes begin. Open to all classes, with instructor's permission.",

We will analyze different ways in which women historically have articulated strategies of contestation and/or resistance to systems of power based on gender differentiation.

We will begin with a deep study of U.S. feminist and queer of color critiques to understand how social formations are embroiled in nationalist, colonial as well as free market ideals and practices. Our focus on the quotidian and staged experiences of those who identify or are identified as an outsider, misfit, or the Other is an invitation to intensively analyze and perform what it means to be at once queer and gendered, queer of color, and queer and wild. From accents and affects to styling and production, we will read a range of manifestos, performances, literature, and art that conform to and yet also deviate from what is normal or acceptable in mainstream, U.S-American society. The key words in the title, \"Of Color, Wildness and Fabulosity,\" are suggestive of alternative queer practices in the U.S. and around the world that engage, exceed or even explode dominant categories of race, gender and sexuality. It explores, in other words, queer theory and praxis using diasporic perception or minority perspectives.",

How do new media technologies and social networking sites change the possibilities for community organizing, public protests, social movements, access to censored material, and coalition building? How, if at all, should the Internet be regulated in order to promote free speech values? What are these values? Are they universal or do they differ depending on time, place, and culture?",
