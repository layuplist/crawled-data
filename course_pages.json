It will begin with a brief historical overview, focusing on the legacies of the colonial era. It will then look critically at a number of modern-day concerns, including agriculture and food security, environmental degradation, health and disease, urbanization, economic aid and restructuring, and the politics of ethnicity and democratization. While we will examine each subject by way of select case studies, emphasis throughout will be on the diversity and changing nature of the African continent.

We will examine this process through literature, film, and music, beginning with the novels to come out of the independence movements in Angola and Mozambique and ending with the spread of reggae and soul across the diaspora. We will look at African American and Afro-Brazilian artistic movements during the period, intercultural exchanges between Africa, Brazil, and the United States, the impact of the women\u2019s movement, and writers\u2019 efforts to creatively re-write the history of the African diaspora in the Americas.

This course focuses on the challenges and opportunities of the most current phase of globalization economies in MENA face that started with the oil boom of 2003. We investigate initially the prognostications of the Washington Consensus, particularly its central argument that the need for neo-liberal reform in the region would led to, and be reinforced, by political liberalization. Using institutional theories, we then discuss how a unique combination of historical legacies, the nature of resources, and financial crisis, led to a re-evaluation of development paradigms in MENA that increasingly included attention to good governance and human resource development. The case studies include distinct sets of countries across the region: the Arab republics, the MENA monarchies, and the Arab Gulf countries. The final section of the course looks at the interaction between national, regional, and global economies of the region.",

We intuitively grasp that the movements of people can have wide-ranging consequences for the sending societies, receiving societies, and the migrants themselves.

In this class, we will apply our nuanced ways of understanding modern mobility to the archaeological past. By addressing the motives, mechanisms, and outcomes of migration through the lens of material culture, we will see how archaeologists can situate past migrations at the forefront of social theory. Our primary focus will be on method and theory, rather than the details of any specific migration.

This course focuses on Islam as practiced in the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, Africa, Central Asia, and in Europe and North America.

Our basic aim is to analytically delineate the metapragmatic/hegemonic stereotype of Japan as a homogeneous ethnolinguistic community and to consider critical alternatives to it. We will explore ethnographic accounts of heterogeneous sites of language-in-use, and address issues such as language standardization, globalization, gender and race relations, subcultures, affect, political economy, etc. Students will learn not just about various sites of linguistic activity in and about Japan, but they will also learn how to situate the Japanese linguistic modernity in a crosscultural, comparative, historical perspective.

The class is timed to coincide with an exhibition entitledMarcel Duchamp: Worlds in a Boxthat will be on display at the Hood Museum of Art in the spring of 2015.",

        "description": "Satire has been used since antiquity as a powerful form of political, social and cultural critique. With humor, sarcasm, and often biting criticism, satire goes beyond pure comedy to speak with a moral voice. The targets of satire range from the world of fashion and the everyday to that of politics and high culture. We will examine case studies of satirical production, from the 18th century through the late 20th century, from the darkly comic prints of Hogarth and Daumier, to the overtly humorous and/or subversive gestures of Duchamp and Dada, Warhol and Pop Art, to the satire of gender roles and modern capitalism in Postmodernism. We will pay particular attention to the role of satire in modern art as it employed irony, parody, ridicule and exaggeration to attack social mores, political figures and the art world status quo. We will also explore the use of satire in film and TV, from the darkly comic (Charlie Chaplin) to the ridiculous (Stephen Colbert). This course hopes to come to terms with the broad range and appeal of satire in the visual arts.",

That act was the culmination of decades of frustration with an established Church that, to many believers, had lost its way. What followed was a European debate for the very souls of men. The Reformation brought into question the assumptions by which most Europeans had lived\u2014that the Church\u2019s teachings, personal good actions, and Christ\u2019s sacrifice could insure their salvation. Using the printing press and artworks, both sides presented their positions in propagandistic language that could be both bombastic and subtle.

One of the main objectives of the course is to look at art practices that attempt to deepen our understanding of the varied cultures, ethnicities and societies that are found in this part of the world. The geographic focus of the course\u2013mostly the Muslim nations of the Arabian peninsula and North Africa\u2013is not meant to perpetuate the assumptions about this region as a monolithic geopolitical entity, nor to blindly label its production according to existing ethnic, religious or national categories. Against media stereotypes of the region, the artists studied in this course have made work that function as a critical platform for rethinking traditional identity formations and extending the space of cultural encounter across borders (territorial, political, linguistic). In many cases these artists may not be living and working in their country of birth but their ethnicity, religion or citizenship continues to inform both their own sense of identity and the terms of their art practice. Some of the topics to be discussed include: artistic responses to the Arab-Israeli conflict, representations of everyday life in times of war, the movement and obstruction of people, goods and information across borders, the rise of new art markets in the Middle East, the politics of gender and sexuality in the Arab world, and the of use archival documents to rethink the meaning of evidence, truth and testimony.",

Drawing on a range of critical texts and artistic practices, we will consider how fundamental aesthetic categories such as materiality and form are transformed through the radical shift from a work-oriented to a medium-oriented conception of art and reality. In broader terms, this module explores the rapidly mutable audio-visual environments/interfaces of the digital age and their impact on social relations and cultural production. We will also examine the tensions between intimacy and distance, distraction and attention, and passivity and participation that characterize image consumption within the routines of contemporary technological culture. Finally, this module offers a historical and political framework for understanding contemporary art\u2019s seeming disavowal of the digital and the expanding non-stop processes of twenty-first-century capitalism that underpin it. At the same time, we will assess some of emancipatory possibilities opened by the accessibility and affordability of digital cameras, editing software and mobile devices.

The weakened grip of the Church contributes to the emerging emphasis on the individual that characterizes Early Modern art. The fifteenth century sees the rise of secular art, the concept of objective realism, the development of panel painting, the commercialization of prints, and the beginnings of independent portraiture. My goal is to give you the knowledge and skills that will enable you to understand and appreciate the nuances and complexity in fifteenth-century artworks wherever you encounter them.

During this time, the Italian peninsula was a hotbed of revolutionary ideas about how architecture could shape and be shaped by the human will. In fact, the Renaissance in Italy saw the emergence of a new type of architecture, which took its cue from the needs, activities, and ambitions of humans. Building practices and styles that were initially based on medieval models gradually evolved in light of the self-conscious discovery and consequent reinterpretation of classical antiquity. The chronological presentation of the material is interspersed with lectures that present some of the broad themes of the course (humanism, the inspirational role of ancient and medieval buildings, living conditions and styles, the profession of the architect, etc.). Accordingly, lectures and textbook readings will focus on the major thinkers, designers, and builders of the period as well as on the economic, political, and religious forces that were at play in the formation of ambitious and beautiful buildings that placed humankind as its center.",

In this course we will place artists like Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco and Frida Kahlo within a broader visual cultural context that includes not only mural art and painting, but also sculpture, architecture, printmaking, photography, installation, film, and performance.

For example, linear algebra is fundamental to stoichiometry and the conservation of matter in chemistry, hydrology and atmospheric dynamics in earth sciences, and cell growth and population dynamics in biology. Moreover, most features of the natural world are probabilistic and frequently best described by probability models, such as the firing of neurons in the brain or the timing of earthquakes. Both are also central to all problems in statistics. This course will explore the application of linear algebra and probability to problems across the sciences.

Indeed, Darwin regarded cooperation as one of the greatest puzzles for his theory of evolution. If natural selection favors individuals that selfishly maximize their own reproductive success, then why should organisms cooperate at all? Yet evidence for cooperation is ubiquitous in biology, b0th across taxa (from bacteria to humans) and across hierarchical levels of biological organization (from genes to cells to multi-cellular organisms to societies). This course will explore how and why cooperation evolves, with the goal of understanding general ecological and evolutionary principles, especially the conditions under which organisms work together and help one another despite competition and conflicting interests. A central focus of the course will be on social interactions among unrelated individuals, particularly how cooperation co-evolves with a form of communication known as 'gossip'-in which third parties are spoken about behind their backs. The course will explore when and why gossip has a positive versus negative impact on cooperation. Students will learn key experimental studies of cooperation and communication (both in nonhumans and humans) and will also be exposed to the conceptual, mathematical, and computational models that predict when cooperation and gossip will be evolutionarily favored.

The schedule is full, including fieldwork, laboratories, lectures and discussions, with emphasis on original research, mostly in small groups of 2-3. Faculty and advanced graduate TAs share field accommodations with students, and are in continuous contact as mentors, day and evening, throughout the program. Students master field and analytical methods (including hypothesis testing, statistical and software skills) for observational and experimental research. We pursue a great variety of research topics, including plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions, processes driving coral reef structure (and coral reef decline), determinants of species distributions, animal behavior, and conservation ecology. Students practice the classic scientific approach: making observations, asking testable questions, generating hypotheses, developing experimental protocols, collecting data, making statistical inferences, writing scientific papers, and presenting seminars. Research papers are published in an annual book. Accommodations are at field stations in Costa Rica, and at a marine laboratory in the Caribbean.",

In fact, the very question of \u201cwhat is a gene?\u201d is even being reconsidered, as the fundamental unit of genomic organization appears not to be the classical DNA-based \u201cgene\u201d but instead is the RNA-based transcript.\u00a0 In this course we will explore these issues and more through lectures, literature discussions, student-led presentations, and student writing assignments.",

This course examines slave systems in the ancient and modern worlds comparatively, focusing on Rome and Brazil. In Rome, the emergence of the state, including the development of the concept of the citizen, coincided with the development of the slave society. African slavery in Brazil was introduced soon after the establishment of the colonial government and drew heavily from classical legal definitions. In this course we compare the social and political structures of these two slave systems (high art, popular culture, institutions). We examine how each slave society was legitimated, perpetuated-and ultimately challenged. Specific topics include: the construction of the slave and the emergence of racializing discourse, the slave trade and the commodification of the body, trickster narratives, modern theories of power and domination, resistance and rebellion, and the problem of freedom for previously dominated peoples. Through comparison, students will not only become aware of the similarities between these two slave societies, but will also be better equipped to evaluate their unique qualities and particular achievements.",

Where did the Greeks acquire the concept of monumental temple architecture and why did they choose to build temples in only two or three different architectural styles? Where did the Greeks learn to write in an alphabetic script and what did they first write down? Who taught the Greeks the art of sculpture and why did they begin by carving what they did? When and why did the Greeks begin to portray their myths in art? May be taken in partial fulfillment of the major in Art History. Open to all classes.",

In this course, particular attention is paid to the material cultural achievements of the richest and artistically most influential of these poleis, the city of Athens, when that city developed the western world's first democracy, built the Parthenon, and played host to the schools established by Plato and Aristotle.

Discussion focuses on how ancient Italic traditions were transformed to suit the needs of the Imperial government (for example, the adaptation of the Republican, Hellenized Domus to the Imperial Palatia). The most dramatic change in religious practice is the development of the Imperial cult. Site analysis will stress the need for an imperial idiom, the accommodation of urban masses and the promotion of a sense of a shared cultural experience.

This course examines slave systems in the ancient and modern worlds comparatively, focusing on Rome and Brazil. In Rome, the emergence of the state, including the development of the concept of the citizen, coincided with the development of the slave society. African slavery in Brazil was introduced soon after the establishment of the colonial government and drew heavily from classical legal definitions. In this course we compare the social and political structures of these two slave systems (high art, popular culture, institutions). We examine how each slave society was legitimated, perpetuated-and ultimately challenged. Specific topics include: the construction of the slave and the emergence of racializing discourse, the slave trade and the commodification of the body, trickster narratives, modern theories of power and domination, resistance and rebellion, and the problem of freedom for previously dominated peoples. Through comparison, students will not only become aware of the similarities between these two slave societies, but will also be better equipped to evaluate their unique qualities and particular achievements.",

The Workshop in Critical Writing introduces graduate students to advanced research techniques, to the conventions of scholarly discourse, and to the various kinds of writing practiced in literary studies. We will analyze scholarly articles as examples of research methods, argument development, rhetorical technique, and stylistic presentation; we will test a variety of practical approaches to the interpretation of literary texts; and we will explore how we might use theory in critical argument. Students will be asked to prepare and submit a scholarly article using previous written work of their own (senior thesis, independent study project) as a basis. The workshop format of the course will permit students to read and critique each other\u2019s work and to sharpen their editorial skills. This course is open to M.A. candidates only.",

It turns out that if you want the protocol to be fault-tolerant, i.e., the protocol works correctly even if one of the agents stops communicating, it is impossible to design a correct protocol (under certain reasonable assumptions about the system).In the course, we will look at several fascinating coordination problems and solve them for several models of distributed computing: shared-memory versus message passing, synchronous versus asynchronous, fault-free versus fault-tolerant.

This course will explore the nature and properties of soils and examine how these processes occur in natural and human-influenced soils, and identify reasonable limits on what can influence the sustainable utilization of soils as a resource. We will begin by developing an understanding of the geologic, biologic, and chemical processes that lead to soil formation and the development of specific soil properties. The second portion of the course will examine the relationship between soils and underlying bedrock and overlying vegetation and the role of soils in ecosystems. The final section of the course will examine the situations in which soils are used to reduce the impact of human activities and the way in which humans can reduce their impact on soils: the importance of soils in septic tanks and leach fields; the use of soils as solid waste landfill caps and liners; the use of soils in the storage of hazardous wastes; and the conservation and management of soils.",

The range of sensors and transducers available will be studied with examples from industry and medical instrumentation. The course will explore in some detail the use of analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) converters and their applications. Students will also learn to use complete A/D-microprocessor-D/A systems since these are part of nearly all instruments now. In this course students will learn to build a complete instrument by combining analog and digital components and using advanced algorithms. We will review the basic concepts from analog electronics and real-time event driven programming one needs to understand in order to construct such instruments and experiment through a series of labs. The course will culminate with group projects to induce the students to go through the design process on a problem of their choice.",

In particular, their respective constructions of a new poetic voice revolve around related notions of the nonhuman world and human-nature relations. In this course, we will approach Whitman\u2019s and Dickinson\u2019s poetry by way of theories and concepts developed in environmentally oriented criticism, or ecocriticism. Beginning with a discussion of ecocriticism\u2019s major theoretical interventions, we will explore its genealogy and recent controversies about ethics and aesthetics, place and displacement, transnationalism and globalization. A reading informed by these debates reveals complex and often ambivalent environmental implications in Whitman\u2019s and Dickinson\u2019s work. We will look at a wide variety of their poems against major nineteenth-century transformations, including shifts in the natural sciences and their relationship to religion, the emerging conservation movement, the political conflicts that led to the civil war, and changing notions of the body, gender, and sexuality.

        "description": "F. O. Matthiessen coined the term \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d in his groundbreaking book,The American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman(1941). At the outset of the nineteenth century American writers struggled with a sense of cultural inferiority and artistic belatedness. The \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d demarcates a period as well as a cultural movement marked by intense literary activity between the 1830s and 1860s that aimed at the formation of a distinctivelyAmericanliterature. Matthiessen restricted the American Renaissance to the years between 1850 and 1855, an \u201cextraordinarily concentrated moment of literary expression\u201d (vii) that saw the publication of Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019sThe Scarlet Letter,House of the Seven Gables, andThe Blithedale Romance; Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019sRepresentative Men; Herman Melville\u2019sMoby-Dick; Henry David Thoreau\u2019sWalden; and Walt Whitman\u2019sLeaves of Grass. In the years since the publication of Matthiessen\u2019s important work, teachers and scholars in American literature have extended the American Renaissance\u2019s chronological provenance at least as far back as the anti-slavery debates in the 1830s and as far forward as the termination of the Civil War. In the past several decades, Matthiessen\u2019s argument has been challenged for its exaggeration of the originality of his coterie of male authors, for the exclusion of women and African-American and popular authors from his account of the United States during a period of remarkable social and cultural transformation, and for its seemingly uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of American exceptionalism. In light of these criticisms, scholars have added Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, Margaret Fuller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mark Twain (among others) to Matthiessen\u2019s American Renaissance pantheon.",

And while no one reads Stevens for his \u201cbric-a-brac\u201d many readers come to Frost for his subjects, which have been misunderstood and sentimentalized over time. It is important to remember, reading him now, that Frost\u2019s New England was no Transcendental retreat, and no rural paradise; poor, depopulated by western expansion on the one hand, and the industrialization of mill towns on the other, it was a landscape of failed and abandoned farmsteads, old people and misfits left to fend on their own, worn-out fields, harsh climate, intellectually moribund and spiritually enervated. Frost came to this \u201csubject\u201d without illusions or bitterness and it is through this subject that we will begin to rethink his poetics and ideas. Using the extensive Frost archives in Rauner, students will be encouraged to undertake primary research alongside their reading of poems and criticism. The course will culminate in a substantial research paper or project, individually designed in consultation with the instructor.",

Exact and approximate solutions of the field equations are used in the study of common loading cases, including tension/compression, bending, torsion, pressure, and combinations of these. In the laboratory phase of the course, various methods of experimental solid mechanics are introduced. Some of these methods are used in a project in which the deformation and stress in an actual load system are determined and compared with theoretical predictions. The course includes several computer exercises designed to enhance the student's under-standing of the principles of solid mechanics.",

As advances in power electronics extend the capability for precise and efficient control of electrical energy to more applications, economic and environmental considerations provide compelling reasons to do so. In this class, the principles of power processing using semiconductor switching are introduced through study of pulse-width-modulated dc-dc converters. High-frequency techniques such as soft-switching are analyzed. Magnetic circuit modeling serves as the basis for trans-former, inductor, and electric machine design. Electromechanical energy conversion is studied in relation to electrostatic and electromagnetic motor and actuator design. Applications to energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, robotics, and micro-electromechanical systems are discussed. Laboratory exercises lead to a project involving switching converters and/or electric machines.",

One goal of the course will be to address the biological aspects of this issue. What is Biodiversity? How is Biodiversity distributed geographically and taxonomically? What does humankind do to cause animal and plant extinctions? Is there a Biodiversity crisis? What is the current rate of extinction and what is the natural extinction rate? What properties of individual species make them vulnerable to extinction? What are the major threats to Biodiversity? The second objective is to examine the social dimensions of Biodiversity. How do our cultural and political perceptions and institutions contribute to the loss of Biodiversity? What value is Biodiversity to humankind? What is being done to preserve Biodiversity in the realms of science, technology, and policy? These questions will be addressed through lecture material, course readings, and writing assignments.",

However, these statutes and regulations overlay a common, judge-made, law of property that establishes a system of private and public property, a law of contracts that governs transactions, and a tort law that provides remedies for intentional and unintentional harms. In addition, there is a growing body of international environmental law with both similarities and differences to U.S. environmental law. The major objectives of this course are to survey today's major environmental laws, explore their history, determine how well they balance ecological, economic, and social sustainability and, finally, to discuss how to improve environmental law to better deal with biodiversity loss, human population growth, energy needs, and climate change in the future.

Regenerative design is a systems-theory based approach to design. \u201cRegenerative\u201d processes restore energy used and materials consumed through a closed loop model where the outputs are equal to the inputs where waste=resources. Through this process, social needs are addressed while diminishing ecological impact, and usable energy, food and additional materials are created instead of waste and the designed system can actually improve the natural environment over time.",

Students will read scholarship and participate in projects that illuminate how meaning is created and negotiated at the levels of industrial production, artistic creation of texts, and audience knowledge and engagement. The screenings, readings, and assignments will ask the student to think about the relations among his/her own position as a scholar, as an audience member, and as a creative artist. This knowledge provides a foundation for critical thinking skills necessary for the student's success in the major. The course is designed for students who have had some introductory exposure to the principles of film and/or television aesthetics and production techniques, but before they have completed their upper division major requirements.All Film majors and Film modified majors should take this course no later than their junior year.",

The goal of the course is first to establish that shifts in climate, vegetation, and landscapes are \"natural\" and have occurred over geologic time and that the timing and magnitude of these shifts provides the necessary background to evaluate the type, magnitude, and frequency of anthropogenic disturbance. The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.",

While we will examine each subject by way of select case studies, emphasis throughout will be on the diversity and changing nature of the African continent. This course will also consider how Africa\u2019s problems are portrayed and understood (and often misunderstood) by the rest of the world.",

The first part of this course covers this historical emergence of middle eastern regimes since the early 1950s.In each country--Libya, Tunisia,Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria--elites have responded differently to the uprising, depending in part on the institutional repertoire each country possessed. As yet, it is unclear what the different trajectories of each country's period of upheaval will be, but they all share important common political elements and developments: transitional arrangements as the first phase of contestation comes to an end, proposed elections leading to constitution-making processes and to referendums that are meant to introduce--or re-introduce--forms of constitutional government.In order to understand this protracted process we will study the mechanics of transition through a comparative case-study approach in particularly Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, and Bahrain. Peripherally we also study the question of why the Arab Gulf states have been relatively immune from popular uprisings, and we incorporate in our discussion as well the role international actors (the United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union, the European Union) have played in the unfolding of the uprisings and beyond.",

The empirical focus of the course is on states and their problems, but its basic precepts are applicable to other domains as well.

Mastering them can contribute to the acquisition of extremely useful analytical and critical skills.

But has global public opinion actually played an important role in international affairs? What are the attitudes of citizens around the world towards some crucial global issues that require international cooperation? Do their attitudes substantially affect states' ability to cooperate to address such issues? In this course, by examining these questions through a variety of assignments (writing a short literature review, making a \"news story\" video, working on a data visualization project, etc.), students will learn important theories and empirical findings on global public opinion. The topics covered include international institutions and human rights, the environment and climate change, nuclear energy, happiness, trust and social capital, global economy, war and peace, terrorism, anti-Americanism, U.S. foreign policy and soft power, soft power competition in Asia, the rise of China, immigration, and foreign aid.",

We then turn to the process of \u201crising\u201d and study how countries achieve economic growth. We examine what is needed for them to sustain growth over time, as opposed to seeing their growth fizzle, as many fast-growing economies have done. We also look at how countries manage the environmental and human consequences of industrialization. We look at how great powers are able (or not able) to develop and deploy effective military power. Finally we examine the causes and consequences of decline\u2014why great powers fall, and whether the process of decline is expected to be stable or unstable.",

We will begin by defining laws and institutions and exploring their general role in shaping and constraining human behavior. We will then turn to specific political institutions, such as political parties, elections, legislatures, the presidency, the courts, juries, and bureaucracies. Among the questions we will answer: Why and how do institutions emerge? What is legislative intent, and how can we uncover it? What rules of interpretation do judges use when deciding cases? Are juries capable of making good decisions? How has lawmaking in the US Congress changed over time? Does the president make rather than enforce laws? Does the bureaucracy faithfully implement policy? Completion of Gov 10 or its equivalent is required for this course. Completion of a course in game theory is recommended.",

        "description": "The goal of this seminar is to present the achievements of Realism as the dominant perspective on international relations while simultaneously cultivating a critical awareness of its limits and biases. The seminar pursues this dual aim by delving into the thought of key 20th-century Realist scholars such as E.H. Carr, Hans Morgenthau, Reinhold Niebuhr, George Kennan, Kenneth Waltz, and John Mearsheimer and subsequently turning attention to a number of alternative approaches which have come to challenge the Realist paradigm since the early 1980s. Examples include the Frankfurt School of critical theory, feminism, and postmodern deconstruction. What is Realism in the first place? Is it coherent? Why is it so popular? What is critical international theory? How is it different from traditional Realism? Is the one perspective better than the other? Guided by questions such as these and careful to treat all theoretical ideas in their proper historical context, the course offers a unique opportunity to gain a nuanced understanding of the purposes, agenda, methodology, and broader epistemological assumptions animating the Realist and critical perspectives. - See more at: https://govt.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/courses/government-seminars/international-relations#sthash.5WxIeKTl.dpuf",

Throughout, students will repeatedly grapple with the following question: what, if any, are the lessons of 9/11 for the United States as it tries to navigate the much more chaotic landscape of international relations in the post-Cold War era? - See more at: https://govt.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/courses/government-seminars/international-relations#sthash.5WxIeKTl.dpuf",

Finally, the course addresses the question of what measures the United States and the international community should take to limit or prevent genocide and mass killing in the future.

All of them lived either on the fringe or with the uncertainty that was a condition of their lives, laboring under the stress of assimilation, displacement, or a threat to their survival. Who were these individuals, and what do their personal narratives offer about themselves, their communities, and their time? Did their dual participation in society contribute to an enriched or problematic identity? What did they create from their ambiguous or excluded status? We\u2019ll also look at the role memoir has played in Jewish life. Does it have a long tradition, or have Jews avoided presentations of the self? Where do memory and survival intersect? How does each writer see him or herself\u2014as a conveyor of individual or collective memory? To what extent is writing rescue of the past, and to what extent affirmation of a future?

All of them lived either on the fringe or with the uncertainty that was a condition of their lives, laboring under the stress of assimilation, displacement, or a threat to their survival. Who were these individuals, and what do their personal narratives offer about themselves, their communities, and their time? Did their dual participation in society contribute to an enriched or problematic identity? What did they create from their ambiguous or excluded status? We\u2019ll also look at the role memoir has played in Jewish life. Does it have a long tradition, or have Jews avoided presentations of the self? Where do memory and survival intersect? How does each writer see him or herself\u2014as a conveyor of individual or collective memory? To what extent is writing rescue of the past, and to what extent affirmation of a future?

This course examines slave systems in the ancient and modern worlds comparatively, focusing on Rome and Brazil. In Rome, the emergence of the state, including the development of the concept of the citizen, coincided with the development of the slave society. African slavery in Brazil was introduced soon after the establishment of the colonial government and drew heavily from classical legal definitions. In this course we compare the social and political structures of these two slave systems (high art, popular culture, institutions). We examine how each slave society was legitimated, perpetuated\u2014and ultimately challenged. Specific topics include: the construction of the slave and the emergence of racializing discourse, the slave trade and the commodification of the body, trickster narratives, modern theories of power and domination, resistance and rebellion, and the problem of freedom for previously dominated peoples. Through comparison, students will not only become aware of the similarities and differences between these two slave societies, but will also be better equipped to evaluate slavery as a discourse of power that facilitates a system of domination.",

Through reading and discussion, students will be exposed to a variety of oral histories and evaluate the uses of individual and/or collective memory as a means of documenting, understanding, and appreciating the past. Oral history will be examined as a literary genre with consideration of how the oral historian becomes a creative writer whose work relies almost wholly on the voices of those interviewed.  The special demands of oral biography will be considered as well.  Issues to be addressed include: the place of oral history -- by nature personal and subjective -- in the larger historical framework; the changes demanded by a shift in medium as the oral historian transfers taped commentary to print; the role of the oral historian/oral biographer as re-caster and re-arranger of memory; evolving recording technologies and the impact of the medium on the oral history's \"message and massage.\" Selected oral histories will be contrasted with and compared to traditional historical accounts of similar events, as well as to one another as regards purpose, methodology, style, and literary effectiveness. The roles and responsibilities of the practitioner as interviewer, archivist, historian, biographer, and artist will be examined and critiqued.  Each student will produce an oral history project with 6-12 voices on a cultural, institutional, local, familial, personal, or event-based topic. On-going guidance will be given by the professors in one-on-one meetings as the student goes through the process of selecting a theme and subjects to interview, preparing for and conducting interviews, transcribing and editing tapes, and fashioning from them the final work. Through discussing their projects in the Workshop component of the course, students will be able to network and benefit from feedback.",

Since you will be expected to write an entire first draft of a feature script within this course, it behooves you to be somewhat prepared. It would help if you have a story in mind, a protagonist, a worthy antagonist, a love-interest (if appropriate), and at least an idea of your beginning, middle and end.

Then we spend the rest of the term critically examining the relationships between global economic integration and changes in international politics and law, as well as the emergence of diverse transnational, national, and sub-national movements opposed to the dominant ideas and practices of economic and political globalization.

        "department": "MALS",
        "description": "Narratives about the emergence of European modernity often link the rise of the modern nation state and the triumph of Enlightenment rationality with the decline of religion in a process of secularization. With an increasing separation of religion and politics, the story goes, religion is relegated to the private sphere while a civic politics occupies the public sphere. A globalized world characterized by networks of communication and cultural exchange might appear, then, as the epitome of a cosmopolitan capitalism and its secular ethos.In the last two decades, however, this narrative of secularization has been called into question in the midst of a \u201creturn of religion\u201d in a \u201cpost-secular society.\u201d Scholarship on political theology, meanwhile, has shown how modern politics and its concept of sovereign power adopt and appropriate religious forms of thought in their secular institutions. Instead of secularization as the decline of religion, critics are rethinking secularization in terms of a hidden afterlife of religion in a secular modernity that is unable to cast aside its theological roots.The course will examine how the return of religion and political theology are transforming politics in a globalized and post-national European modernity. In what ways might religion undergird the call for a \u201cradical Enlightenment\u201d that exceeds national boundaries? How might a post-secular society entertain a dialogue of religion and the secular through mutual translation? How might religion provide a basis not only for the theory of sovereign power but for forms of resistance in which the public sphere is contested?We will tackle these questions through readings of classical texts (Luther, Hobbes, Spinoza, Kant, Schmitt) alongside the work of twentieth-century and contemporary German, French, and Anglo-American critics (de Vries, Casanova, Hardt and Negri, Arendt, Lefort, Foucault, Said, L\u00f6with, Blumenberg, Habermas, Taylor, Asad).",

As scholars in an increasingly interdisciplinary environment, our work is necessarily shaped by those peers with whom we share our ideas, as well as by current trends in our respective fields. Within the growing field of memory studies, thinkers from such varied disciplines as anthropology, political science, history, literary studies, and psychology continue to analyze the uses and abuses of individual and collective memory formations.

The most important of these changes is the development and diffusion of new global media. Indeed it seems fair to say that what most people mean when they use the word \u201cglobalization\u201d today would not exist without the new global media.  We begin the term by examining various conceptual discourses about the character and meaning of globalization, the media, and cultural change and survival.

Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments. The course will begin with an examination of the notion of Aboriginal self-government in Canada and develop it in light of the policy recommendations found in the recent report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). Using the Canadian experience as a benchmark, students will then compare these developments to indigenous peoples' experiences in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. An important theme of the course will be to develop an international approach to the issue of indigenous rights and to explore how colonial governments are responding to indigenous demands for justice.

Philosophical defenses of the right to free speech, developed in the context of the town square and the printing press, have yet to catch up with the revolution in communication brought about by the Internet. Technological innovations such as social media have made it possible to communicate instantaneously with hundreds of millions of people around the world and have, for purposes of regulating speech, rendered national boundaries virtually irrelevant. There is now an urgent need to determine how to assess and protect the values of free speech in this global context. Questions we will discuss include: Is there a universal human right to freedom of expression? If so, what is the philosophical basis for it? What are its limits? Does it protect racist hate speech as well as political dissent? How should the different free speech regimes currently in effect in different countries be reconciled in cases of conflict?",

The ever-repeated maxim of a cohesive, friendly and tolerant people living under a peaceful social contract has been corroded by facts and figures, dismissing classic anthropological interpretations such as that of \"democracia racial\", proposed by Gilberto Freyre. For decades now, literature, theater, cinema and popular music have been anticipating these shifts, producing deviant discourses that puts brutality, unfairness, racism, oppression and violence at the core of Brazilian society. This course will trace representations of violence in a wide range of Brazilian artistic expressions, from mid-19th century to the present. Along with literary texts, music, cinema, photography, graphic novels and visual art, we will examine some critical and theoretical approaches to better understand concepts like artistic representation and social violence.",

We will consider self's development, its cognitive and affective components, motives related to it, and how it is regulated. We will consider its functional basis, examining both its adaptive and maladaptive consequences.\u00a0 We will also examine its neurological basis, including case studies of peple with disorders of self.",

The student and faculty will work together to structure the study program and set goals that are to be met by the end of the term.  The course of study may include, but is not limited to, literature review, seminar attendance, online course material, small projects, and presentations related to the specific field being studied. Assignment of credit or no-credit will be given at the end of the term.",

Individuals will identify a QBS faculty member who will guide them in choosing a current paper related to their research or published by their lab.\u00a0 This faculty member will also advise the student on the paper presentation format and attend the journal club that week.\u00a0 The presentation should include a brief discussion of the significance of the paper as well as a description of the methods used. While the presenter should be prepared to lead the discussion, members of the journal club are expected to come with questions about the paper. These questions can focus on methods, discussion, and interpretation of the results and their implications.This course will meet for a 1.5-hour discussion every other week. Winter: EpidemiologyWinter: EpidemiologyGraduate level journal club focused on interpreting scientific literature specific to epidemiological and biomedical research studies. Students will learn about the key aspects of a scientific study, how to critically evaluate epidemiological and biomedical research studies and how to effectively communicate study findings to others. Students will meet weekly and discuss one to two publications. Publications will cover key epidemiological and study design concepts.

We review concerns about the loss of community and connection, and about the barriers to access and advancement faced by those with less social capital.

Artistic disciplines during the Soviet period were firmly entrenched within cultural industries that featured union memberships, the means to control production, distribution, and exhibition. Nonetheless, what was popular throughout Russo-Soviet history did not always emanate from state guided channels. How do we account for what we perceive as \u201canomalies\u201d in Russian popular culture: why did people listen to American jazz music under Stalin? Why were Bollywood films more popular than Soviet comedies? Why were Brazilian and Mexican telenovelas standard viewing in Soviet homes? How did the presence of foreign texts relate to the multi-ethnic makeup on the Soviet Union? How were founding mythologies of the nation encoded/rejected in domestic texts? \u00a0 While popular culture encompasses a multitude of media, special attention will be paid to trends in music and cinema, offering students a comprehensive, historical arc of each medium\u2019s development in Russia. The course will seek to establish a working definition of what we actually mean by \u201cRussian popular culture.\u201d Firstly, how do we differentiate between categorizations of mass culture versus popular culture? Secondly, we will challenge the notion of national culture when referring to the terms \u201cRussian\u201d and \u201cSoviet\u201d culture throughout the semester. Each unit is organized around the construct of \u201csvoi\u201d (\u201cours\u201d) vs. \u201cchuzhoi\u201d (\u201ctheirs\u201d), offering the class a point of comparison for how domestically produced culture often rivaled official foreign imports and blackmarket, unofficial distributed products. We will also explore larger, universal questions that revolve around top-bottom and bottom-up models of how popular culture operates. What does popular culture mean in the capitalist market context, and how might that definition change under socialism?",

By thoroughly studying one of the world's richest oral traditions, Slavic folk life and folklore, we will acquire the tools and techniques necessary for collecting, documenting, and interpreting folklore -- which is perhaps the most truly international of all arts.

        "description": "This course examines the impact which the turbulent history of twentieth- and twenty-first century Russia has had on literature and on writers struggling to defend their integrity. The beginning of the last century witnessed an unprecedented burst of literary and artistic creativity: the late flowering of the great realist tradition coincided with the advent of modernism, a worldview defined by an insatiable hunger for novelty, will to experiment, taste for scandal and provocation, and bohemian lifestyles. The modernist schools and movements-symbolism, futurism, acmeism, imagism, and suprematism-were terminated in the 1930s by Stalin. Since then, despite decades of censorship and material hardship, Russian writers have continued to produce one of the world's greatest literatures. Readings will include Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, works by such authors as Chekhov and Pasternak, and samples from the radical avant-garde. Readings will be supplemented by excursions into Russian cinema, fine arts, photography, cyber-punk and contemporary performance art.",

As he himself put the problem, \u2018Is there any meaning in my life which the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy?\u2019 In his quest for bulwarks against that fear, he studied the great philosophers and he examined closely the value system of the peasants. He found temporary relief in war and in marriage, but the definitive solution always eluded him. The evolution of this theme, and the formal devices by which Tolstoy expressed it in his prose, will be traced in the major novels, War and Peace and Anna Karenina. The course will conclude with a brief examination of the prose that Tolstoy produced after his conversion. Taught in English. Open to all classes.",

Yet rarely are such reports accompanied by a discussion of the systematic causes of these problems. More often we become witness to an endless stream of media coverage reporting seemingly isolated incidents. Seldom are we informed of the decision-making process by which some social problems become selected for coverage, while others are ignored. The purpose of this course is to subject the coverage of modern social problems to an in-depth, critical analysis. We will attempt to answer such questions as: \"how does a social problem become defined as such?\" and \"what are the causes or sources of various social problems?\" Open to all classes.",

        "description": "Images of subjugated veiled women and seductive harem dancers are arguably the pivotal figures of Western Orientalism. Stereotypes of Arab and Muslim women continue to proliferate today's media, U.S. film industry, and even the visual and performing arts. Studying the genealogy of such images becomes ever more crucial, especially as the Middle Eastern woman and representations of her body take center stage in contemporary debate and conflict between religions, cultures, and values. Therefore, this course will focus on unpacking the histories, cultures, politics, and ideologies performed through and around the Orient, the Oriental woman and her dancing body. Through mapping the larger political economy of Oriental dance, its appropriation and circulation from the east to the west and the reverse, we will pay particular attention on the histories of race, sexuality, identity, class, nation, and gender formations that the dance tells. We will also focus on the ways in which Islam and Arab Eastern cultures have fostered their own responses and stereotypes towards female performers with a take on their rationalizations of morality, gender roles and sexuality. Topics such as self-exoticism and self-Orientalism in relation to identity and nation building politics will be discussed. Lastly, we will be asking whether and how dance, arts, and the humanities can shape, alter, and deconstruct such perceptions. Through examining and analyzing a number of theoretical texts, travelers' accounts, and cultural productions\u2014such as photography, theater, concert dance, and cinema\u2014this course will explore how and why archetypal representations of the Orient have been created and continue to shape western understandings of the Middle East and its women.",

Although it is an introduction to the use of voice in the theater, it is in no way limited to the actor. A specific progression of exercises will be presented to facilitate freeing the body of tensions, discovering the natural breath, releasing vibrations of sound from the body, and opening the channel for sound (throat, jaw, tongue). Resonance, vocal freedom, and articulation will also be explored. Techniques for accessing emotional and psychological truth will be practiced as fundamental to the actor's creative process. A groundwork will be laid for physical and vocal presence. Each student will be responsible for the development and practice of a vocal warm-up. A variety of speaking assignments will be made to develop confidence, presence and emotional expressivity. Text materials utilized will emerge from self-scripted autobiographical storytelling. A strong commitment to the work is necessary to explore what it means to find one's voice. Do not pre-register for this course: registration is invalid without permission from the instructor. To enroll in this course you must first interview with the instructor. Interviews are conducted on the first day of classes.

What is the effect of gender on participation in the work force and politics, on language, and on artistic expression? We will also explore the changing patterns of relationships between the sexes and possibilities for the future. Open to all students.",

This course will examine the historic influence of women on the field of journalism, from Nellie Bly's turn-of-the-century undercover exposes to today's newsroom professionals. How has the growing number of women journalists affected the coverage of women's issues such as welfare, abortion, and health crises such as breast cancer? How do women deal with \"objectivity\" in covering these issues? We will look at new styles in literary journalism pioneered by women, notably Frances Fitzgerald on Vietnam, Joan Didion on cultural issues in 60s and 70s, Oriana Fallaci on world leaders, and Sheryl WuDunn on China. We will analyze the work of women columnists who have changed the face of political discourse in the U.S., and examine the historical contributions of muckrakers like Ida Tarbell and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells Barnett. This course will involve critical reading, original reporting, and several article-length papers. Students will be expected to produce a publishable, magazine-length article at the end of the term.",

Our focus on the quotidian and staged experiences of those who identify or are identified as an outsider, misfit, or the Other is an invitation to intensively analyze and perform what it means to be at once queer and gendered, queer of color, and queer and wild. From accents and affects to styling and production, we will read a range of manifestos, performances, literature, and art that conform to and yet also deviate from what is normal or acceptable in mainstream, U.S-American society. The key words in the title, \"Of Color, Wildness and Fabulosity,\" are suggestive of alternative queer practices in the U.S. and around the world that engage, exceed or even explode dominant categories of race, gender and sexuality. It explores, in other words, queer theory and praxis using diasporic perception or minority perspectives.",

How do new media technologies and social networking sites change the possibilities for community organizing, public protests, social movements, access to censored material, and coalition building?

        "description": "This two-term course in first-year composition works on the assumption that excellence in writing arises from serious intellectual engagement. To achieve this excellence,WRIT 2-WRIT 3enrolls students into intensive, seminar-style classes in which literary and other works (including the students' own) are read closely, with attention to substance, structure, and style. The primary goal ofWRIT 2is for students to learn to write clearly and with authority. By submitting themselves to the rigorous process of writing, discussing, and rewriting their papers, students come to identify and then to master the essential properties of the academic argument.  InWRIT 3, students engage in the more sustained discourse of the research paper. These papers are not restricted to literary criticism but might employ the research protocol of other academic disciplines. Throughout the reading, writing, and research processes, students meet regularly with their teaching assistants and professors, who provide them with individualized assistance.  Note: Writing 2-3 is taken in place of Writing 5. Students must complete both terms of Writing 2-3 and a First-year Seminar to fulfill the first-year writing requirement. Students who take theWRIT 2-WRIT 3sequence defer their First-year Seminar until the spring term. Writing 2-3 does not serve in partial satisfaction of the Distributive Requirement.",
