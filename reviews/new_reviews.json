I wished semiotics had been a more significant part, if not the focus of, the class.",
    "professor": "Not a great professor. He seems bored with everything he does, he&apos;s a rather tough grader, and he doesn&apos;t help your writing at all. I received no feedback on my final paper (the only research paper, so it would have been nice to know how to improve, or if I even did well). He didn&apos;t help me improve my writing in any way.",

The only issue was the final paper (which I&apos;ve already said was the best part of the class). There was very little time to do enough research (1 week, I could&apos;ve used 2) and then write a 10 page paper about it, but if you don&apos;t mind spending 3-4 evening of your reading period to do a good job, go for it.

There was a whole lot of writing, but if you can find a Seminar with minimal workload/writing, you&apos;re probably in the class everyone else wanted.

If anything, it was almost too slow.",

I&apos;ve heard a lot of good things about Shepherd, so I was bummed not to be taking from him.",

I had thought that the daily Short Assignments were going to be irritating, but they turned out not only to be extremely helpful for learning the material, but also even a little fun, tinkering with the program until it worked.

Lectures consisted of Marcelo working through derivations and sample problems. Problem sets came from the textbook, which was phenomenal. I&apos;ve never had a textbook that was more helpful and well written. Great tool to study from. Subject matter is interesting; applications in engineering and higher level physics are made clear. E&amp;M is conceptually less intuitive than mechanics, but not much harder once you learn the fundamental laws. ",
    "professor": "Marcelo is AWESOME!! Definitely the best prof I had my freshmen year. He has a passion for his subject area that is unmatched, and loves teaching at every level. His lectures are clear as can be, and the best part was all of his tangents. We once spent 20 minutes as a class(which was only 7 people) discussing string theory and why he gave up on it. He talked about his research often, which was really interesting, because he is definitely a leader in theoretical physics. All in all, I never thought somebody could make me want to be a physics major so much! Even if it&apos;s physics 1/2, everyone should take a class with Marcelo."

I was unsure about taking P15 since I only took Physics B in high school and basically just needed physics for the engineering prereqs, but i&apos;m so glad i took the honors course. The problem sets were very engaging, especially once we got into the material that no one had ever seen before on relativity and quantum mechanics. They were of course very difficult, but the TA was great at helping you get started on any problem.  Lectures could be a bit dry at times, but that was mostly during the beginning of the course, at which point we were basically reviewing classical mechanics. Now again, it is a harder class than P13, and should only be taken if you took Physics C in high school or you are a calculus and physics ace. But totally worth the work if you can do it.",
    "professor": "Barrett was not the best prof I&apos;ve had, but as you will realize, teaching physics can be done one way: by doing it. Lectures would consist of Barrett working through derivations and applications, which would frequently be mimicked on homeworks. He was much better at inspiring interest when we got to more advanced material on quantum mechanics. I can&apos;t say that I didn&apos;t fall asleep at times when he was in the middle of some lengthy derivations. "

Everything ties back to them (Iliad, Plato, etc.) so if you&apos;re only interested in literature in general and not necessarily classics, this may not be the course for you. That said, I was not particularly enamored with the greco-roman classics either, but I don&apos;t regret reading anything in this course. It really all boils down to what professor you are assigned for discussion section. Some, like Chaudhuri, are not as great at facilitating discussion between the students themselves (rather than with just him), but others I&apos;ve heard have great discussions, so it all depends. You will, however, be guaranteed a group of peers in the class who really care about doing well and that rubs off - apathy is something that doesn&apos;t carry well in a class like Humanities 1/2.",
    "professor": "Professor Chaudhuri loves to tear apart papers. He admitted it himself. It took a couple times, but I think eventually most people in our discussion section were hardened to his criticism. In person, during office hours, he&apos;s markedly different, much... nicer, and he&apos;s usually fair in his grading - his expectations are very high and A&apos;s are scarce, but he&apos;ll reward improvement when he sees it.",
    "workload": "It&apos;s a lot of reading, and getting ahead on weekends and such is definitely advisable. Also, they give out pop quizzes on the lectures, so make sure to study those before every discussion section, especially key words like Greek terms, names of writers and works of art mentioned in lecture, etc. The papers are pretty spaced out though, so there is plenty of time to go to RWIT and talk it through with them once or twice or even thrice."

But the class is GREAT -- usually very small, and the prof is always directly engaging you and your classmates (often via conversation with you) every minute of the class. It&apos;s fun and very low-key in class (lots of silly sentences result). Almost all of the material is initially self-taught via homework that usually just tells you to look at the textbook (it&apos;ll be pretty obvious in your small class the next day if you didn&apos;t do it)--and the textbook is free and online. The major drawback to the class is that the only drill section is 7:45am. Yikes. But in my class at least we went to breakfast together afterward in the time between drill and class, which was fun. Oh, did I mention that after the first day you don&apos;t speak English in the classroom anymore? (Don&apos;t worry--somehow it all works out.)",

The one thing is, if you want to ask her questions in ENGLISH, you have to go to office hours (or you can ask your drill instructor). She is very generous grading most work (quizzes can sometimes be harsh if it&apos;s fill-in-the-blank and there can&apos;t be partial credit, but if there is a partial credit opportunity, she has been known to take off one-tenth of a point for a mistake, just to give you an idea).",
    "workload": "Because class is 5 days per week, there&apos;s a LOT of time invested in nightly homework (most of which isn&apos;t turned in, but it is immediately and painfully obvious if you didn&apos;t do it, and it&apos;ll be a nightmare catching up for the next quiz or test since they happen on a pretty regular basis). That said, if you keep up every night or almost every night, there&apos;s not going to be a single day when you&apos;re crushed by the workload from this course--it&apos;s pretty well spaced out and constant (with new material every two days), so even though I spent the most time outside of class on Japanese versus my other two courses, it wasn&apos;t the direct cause of any near-sleepless nights."

You have to sort of already know the answer beforehand in order to understand what the professor is getting at. Fortunately, though, you can go to office hours/ help hours/ T.A. hours to get extra help if you are unable to follow the lecture. Having the professor teach me individually during office hours was very helpful. During his lecture, I would not understand a concept, and he would just keep going, and since the material is cumulative, I was basically screwed. He just goes too fast during the lecture for me to follow, and he&apos;s just not great at explaining the logic of the algorithms or the purpose of each of the data structures. I think it&apos;s because he just assumes we know certain things already. That&apos;s why I would highly recommend going to his office hours to have him clarify some of the steps he sometimes skims over or just assumes we know. He is very friendly during office hours, and you don&apos;t have to worry about being bothersome to him because he is genuinely happy to help you. I&apos;m a pretty shy person, so at first I was really uneasy about going to him for help. However, by the end of the term, I was just so desperate that I had to, and I&apos;m really glad I did because otherwise, I&apos;m sure I would&apos;ve died on the final. If I could change one thing, it would be to go to office hours more often and not have been so reserved until it was almost too late. I had taken c.s. in high school and gotten a 5 on the AP CS A, so I sort of felt invincible going into the class and was like, &quot;I dont&apos; need no help,&quot; but I was absolutely wrong. Getting help early, for the tests and for the labs, is super important. Sorry I made this so long. Good luck!",

I feel like everyone, including me, thought they could just be CLUTCHBEAST and do the labs on the second to last day or last day, but DON&apos;T do that. Also, I always study like... one or two days before test because I am the procrastinating kind, but DON&apos;T do that either. It is easy to fall dangerously behind very fast, because concepts are cumulative (to some extent), and it takes time to think things over and finally understand the logic of it. When I eat or walk around campus to go somewhere, I am usually thinking about the comp sci material we just learned because, for me at least, the material isn&apos;t something you can just get immediately. It takes time to figure out the logic before it finally clicks. Most people reading this are probably going to be like, &quot;No I&apos;m so smart. I can do anything. This reviewer is probably just some noob who isn&apos;t made for the c.s. major and should probably go do the Econ major,&quot; but I promise you I am legit (not to be arrogant). I scored really well on the final and did really well on the problem sets, and I still thought the course was super hard and that staying on top of the homework and material is super important.

As a result, this professor&apos;s very clear and thought-out lecture was useless because the students did not have any way to study and fully internalize the concepts.

I highly recommend looking at the proofs in the notes, the homework problems, and the practice midterms/final. Many of his test questions come directly from there. Don&apos;t even open the textbook, and don&apos;t even register for the online thing (Aplia or something) that he provides. That was a waste of almost 100$. They are UTTERLY useless. Nothing in the lecture or on the tests had anything from the textbook or the online thing. I would know because I have never used the textbook or the online thing, and could do (or at least had the ability to do) every test question. Also, don&apos;t freak out about the problem sets because they are basically impossible to do and he&apos;ll go over them in class and give you all the answers. Then just understand how he got those answers and be ready to repeat or do something very similar on the test. Overall, the workload was very little, but make sure you understand all the notes and all the practice tests and homework problems, and you&apos;re set!

Just to give you some perspective, for my Writing 5 course with Professor Piper, I got a B+/A- on my first essay and an A- on the second essay. Back then, I was a TERRIBLE writer.

It seems like he just wants a way to take off points). Furthermore, the time limit forces you to be a little hurried during the test, leading to careless mistakes that are not indicative of your understanding of the material. Furthermore, considering that an A is a 96%, it&apos;s basically impossible to get an A since the tests and homeworks are so faulty. Some of the test questions are also not covered in the textbook or lecture, so that the only way to get them right is to already know them from some random knowledge you have beforehand. I am very angry about how unfair this course was, and I feel like it has been a complete waste of my time because the concepts taught were so ridiculously simple. He just does trivial things to make the grades lower. This class has been my worst experience at Dartmouth so far.\n\nDo not let this class discourage you from becoming an Econ major though. This class is not an accurate representation of what other Econ classes are like. Some people actually even like this class, so perhaps you might too. I know that I&apos;m in the minority for not liking this class, but I think I have more than enough reasons to justify my disappointment.

Too many slides, too  many words on the slides (some basically directly from the textbook), so it can be hard to figure out what you should take away from the lectures and what the key points are.\n\nBoth of these profs put the slides as well as lecture recordings online, which was GREAT!!",

    "course": "Full disclosure: I am a history major with an interest in the interactions between the West and the East, and while I&apos;m not personally religious, I like to consider myself pretty respective of those who are. \n\nThis course was one of those sleeper hits -- I enrolled out of mild curiosity, fully expecting to shop this and other courses, but I ended up becoming engrossed in the course material. I learned so much fascinating stuff on so many different levels, because it provided new information, insight, and perspective on not only Korean and American history, but also my own personal life (as an immigrant family). This course treats the clash of two different civilizations, but not in the usual context of war, foreign government takeovers, or economic interests, but rather largely from the perspective of religion, including well-meaning Christian missionaries who often genuinely came to love the Korean nation and people. The course also traces the general history of Christianity (including Catholicism) and other off-shoots of it in (mostly modern) Korean history, all of which I found fascinating and brand-new. Professor Suh tended to focus on the lives of several relatively unknown Christians, both Korean and non-Korean, throughout modern Korean history, and it was such a refreshing new take on the tendency of history courses to generalize trends.\n\nFinally, in terms of structure and the formalities of the course, I found everything to be pretty clear cut, in terms of organization, and seriously, I&apos;m actually grateful for the weekly responses (posted on Blackboard) because I used them as an excuse to read all the readings carefully (though you really don&apos;t have to read all of them, even) -- and Professor Suh chose some wonderful and fascinating readings for us to read! This is the ONE class in all of Dartmouth where I voluntarily went back to read material I&apos;d missed during a busy week because I was THAT sure I would enjoy and learn from the readings.\n\nI can&apos;t stress how much I learned and was engaged by this course. Definitely one of my favorite courses at Dartmouth, and I say this as a senior. Take it if you can!",
    "professor": "Professor Suh is relatively new to Dartmouth, which means she still struggles to understand our expectations and norms. That being said, she is SO dedicated to her courses and students, pouring her heart into every part of her lectures, and she welcomes (almost demands) feedback from her students. She&apos;s so approachable and enthusiastic, and once you get past her occasional grammatical errors and accent, you&apos;ll find her to be very thoughtful, intelligent, interesting, and compassionate. Oh, and don&apos;t be fooled by how strict the syllabus seems -- she&apos;s so accommodating, from pushing back deadlines to formatting her exams. She also treated us (on the department&apos;s dime) to a Yama meal at the end of the term and really tries to be there for you as a professor and mentor. She encourages discussion from the students as well, which I personally appreciated a lot because I suddenly found myself flooded with questions and thoughts about the material throughout the term.",
    "workload": "I usually did all of the readings the night before and the day of the weekly responses (due at 5pm on Monday or Tuesday, I believe), which were basically 1-2 paged (single or double spaced) summaries and/or reflections on the readings. You get one free pass -- you can miss one week&apos;s weekly response. Other than that, the tests are pretty straightforward (I hesitate to specify the format, because she&apos;s still evolving her teaching style every term and it might be different next year) and there&apos;s a research essay -- pretty standard for any history course. During the term, she often pushed back deadlines or forgave a couple of weeks for response papers depending on student feedback and stuff, so she&apos;s pretty flexible."

The material is not difficult and unlike a lot of other Bio classes, there&apos;s not a ton of information to memorize. This made for incredibly frustrating tests that involved deciphering confusing, tricky questions designed to artificially generate a curve (One question was literally a picture of a graph that showed up once in one of his powerpoints and a prompt that said: &quot;Label the axes&quot;). Class consisted of only five 20 point quizzes and a final. The small number of questions meant that a couple mistakes could result in scores at or below the median. Thankfully, professor Jack lets you drop your lowest score. Overall, a poorly designed course that was most likely designed to weed out students. However, Bio 11 is a necessary evil to get to more interesting biology classes and this is probably the least painful of the offerings at Dartmouth. ",

Then, students are docked points for these assumptions in their grade. Asking for clarification from the professor is nearly useless because the professor is oftentimes unclear about what the assignment asks himself. One time, when a student asked if HTML tags need to be parsed out for the tinysearch engine project, the professor said to the student that choosing to parse out HTML tags is a &quot;design choice&quot;.

Sure, some students have learned most of the material before, or are just very fast learners, but what about those who need more time to figure things out?

It really depends on the guest lecturer that day.  I would have much preferred to read this stuff on my own than to take this class.  The class setting was also tough because nobody was engaged, and almost nobody participated.  I learned a lot about what three students had to think about German literature.  Still, they took attendance daily (again high school), which was certainly the main attraction.  ",

A large portion of the grade was based on bi-weekly reading quizzes with fill in the blanks.  These tests were trivial, eerily reminiscent of high school, and difficult.  I read every shred of the material in this class, and the reading quizzes were still impossible.  Simultaneously, they were prone to cheating, which made it difficult to keep up with what I would estimate to be more than a quarter of the class.  The exams were a little more insightful, but they still asked surface level questions about the reading.  At the end of the day, I wonder whether some thorough wikipedia research would be just as adequate as the readings.  ",

Mostly, the work was frustrating because the sense of purpose in this class was very low.  You could read all you wanted, and you would probably still do poorly on the reading quizzes.  Then, since the exam questions were simple, you would probably not have much of an edge even if you did do the work.  Somehow this class turned out to be fairly difficult, and not in an engaging sort of way.  It was more that easy material turned out to yield low grades.  "

Professor Loeb is much more into the animation aspect of the course while Professor Wheatley is more into the psychology aspect of motion. A really interesting combo/pair of profs. Loeb is more animated and excited while Wheatley is somewhat serious ( a bit intimidating) but each one is very knowledgeable in her respectful field. My only complaint is that the course was a bit disorganized at times which may be because it&apos;s taught by two different profs but I&apos;m not sure. ",
    "workload": "So for the first half of the term the workload was I would say managable busy-work. We did 3 journals every week in which we just observed motion in our world and in addition to that we would have 1 or 2 legit journal assignments that were focussed on what we had learned in class. Not too difficult but this can easily become a &quot;let me do this last minute&quot; type of course, which in turn sets you up for failure during the final project. So about 40% of your grade is based on the journals and participation while the other 60% is based on a research project you work on with 2 or 3 other students. Hurray for group projects (sarcasm)... So this project is supposed to focus on one of the five motion topics covered in class. You choose a theme then get put into a group and then together in the group you design a project or research method to test out what ever it is in motion you&apos;re focussing on. This can get  tricky because although Loeb is more into animation Wheatley is more into the statistical methods of research gathering in psychology. This means that you should/have to collect data and know how to properly analyze it (something you kind of can&apos;t do unless you&apos;ve taken one of those annoying Stats 10 classes: psych 10, socy 10, etc.). My advice is pick something that&apos;s easy to research and test out to get valid numbers otherwise you may end up with some obscure data that you have no clue what to do with. You present your research to the class in a 15 minute presentation (make sure to have your data ready) and the class has 5 minutes for questions. Then you write a 15-20 page research paper summarizing everything you did and what you discovered. Overall the course has a chilled vibe to it and you learn all kinds of different applications of motion but it starts slow and just takes off very suddenly. \n"

Along with the weekly quizzes and midterm, this might seem intimidating, but as long as you start things well ahead of time (i.e. not two days before the deadline) you will end up fine.\nTo prepare for the quizzes and midterm, study groups work well! Piazza (the online platform which hosts the course materials) is also really helpful for posting questions and answering your peers&apos; questions, since you can post anonymously to spare yourself the inevitable shame of the 11 PM last-minute pleas for help.\nOverall, less work than a typical CS course but still enough to keep you up late some nights."

Compounded with the disorganized class structure, you had no idea what was coming up.\n\n2. to be fair, on our second test, the concept IDs were now all recognizable and key concepts. but this time, prof lind becomes INCREDIBLY picky with our responses, while the responses could only be 2 sentences long (she takes off points if you write more than this). this was a true guessing game - one had no idea what EXACTLY she thought was an ideal answer. she took off small points here and there, and given that the whole test was worth 24 points, a few points here and there due to her nitpicky grading screwed you over.\n\nas a &quot;bonus,&quot; she also takes forever to grade.",

She would give you a term and then expect you to define it in only two sentences. After the first exam I realized that the best way to accomplish this was to state how the term (a) related to East Asia and (b) related IR concepts or IR theory. If you do both of those things, you should be fine.\n\nOther than that, she was a good professor.",

Additional readings were interesting and illuminating. Ultimately gave me a glimpse of what bigger-picture math looks like and left me heavily considering the major.",

The midterm and final are straight from memorization, though there is quite a lot to memorize.  But as long as you are thorough in your descriptions on your exams, you should be okay.  The format is 10 art pieces, where you have 3 minutes to describe each one.  Then you have 10 minutes to compare/contrast two art pieces that he gives you.  Just write fast, it&apos;s quite time constraining. Good thing that the final is non-cumulative! There is one research paper about 8-9 pages on an artwork that he gives you a couple choices for, and you just have to dig in to information you can find about it.  Took a lot of work, in my opinion, but that&apos;s the general thing for any research paper.",

The first half focused a lot on ancient Korea and the development of Korea, but since the prof&apos;s specialty is art history we ended up learning a lot about ancient Korean art...Yes, the historical aspects were just like a normal history class but a lot of students were annoyed at having to study art as well.  First half grades are based on two quizzes, non-cumulative, and they&apos;re really straightforward if you just memorize the historic and artistic facts. Also you need to watch a couple movies and write responses to them, but these are super easy. Oh, there&apos;s a group presentation as well, which is easy. Second half was more about modern Korea, from 19th-20th centuries, and I found it a lot more interesting.

Glinert also seemed to know very little about the entire middle part of the syllabus, focusing on art relating to Jerusalem.  The result was him showing us pictures, describing them, and then not knowing or refusing to disclose any meaningful analysis, which is would justify by suggesting that he was leaving that as an exercise for us, or that he simply couldn&apos;t give us all the answers.

He is stuck in his ways, uninteresting, and essentially just an old fuddy-duddy who cares more to hear himself talk about literally anything--his long tangents were rarely related to the course material--than to meaningfully engage with the students about the course material.

Still, getting an A is definitely doable if you put in the time and are interested enough in the material.",

That said, my perspective changed and my views were challenged as a result of this course (so I&apos;m grateful for that), though I&apos;m probably in the minority when I say that. If you go in with an open mind, I think you&apos;ll get a lot more out of it - most students were resolute in their opinions and very willing to dismiss the alternative perspectives presented in the material that we read in class.\n\nThe structure of the course was a lot like a high school course - circuitous, overly-PC discussions and activities, minimal work outside of class. The readings are sufficient to learn about issues, so I wish class time were allocated for discussions or debates (because that would have made the class a lot more riveting and effective). Instead, we got regurgitations of what we covered in the books or did group activities that felt kind of useless.\n\nAll in all, decent course in terms of workload and easiness.

She would also sometimes go over the major points in the chapter, but I really don&apos;t think you could get away without reading the book. (While this was a tedious way to learn, I feel like I learned the material very well because of it.)\nShe&apos;s very good at answering questions, though. She is also very good during office hours and really makes an effort to meet with you even if you can&apos;t make it during the scheduled office hours. ",

(And it&apos;s very dense reading; you are essentially teaching yourself when you read for this class.) Also for M-W-F there are 3-ish homework problems from the book (which take longer than you would expect a mere 3 problems to take, because some might be proofs) ---- the homework problems from a full week are formally due all together the following Monday. \nDue Mondays: &quot;Special&quot; Homework - a proof that can sometimes be quite time-consuming. If you don&apos;t get credit, you can rewrite it (which creates more work). I think we ended up having five special assignments all term, total.\nEvery Monday: Quiz - all these quizzes are totaled up to give another midterm grade.\nWARNING: There are take-home components to the midterm and final. These are SO time-consuming because they are mostly proofs, and they are HARD proofs. \nSo the workload was huge. But, I will say that none of it felt like busy work, so that&apos;s a plus. I would say only take this class if you are seriously interested in becoming a math major. \n\n"

I came into this class knowing literally NOTHING about programming, so I thought I would be at a disadvantage, but my lack of experience didn&apos;t hurt me at all. Prof. Farid doesn&apos;t assume any prior knowledge at all. ",
    "professor": "Prof. Farid is an incredible professor. He is super clear, funny, receptive to questions, and makes the class feel small despite its large size. I have nothing but good things to say about him. He&apos;s also very accessible at office hours, and he answers emails at lightning speed. And he isn&apos;t full of himself either.",
    "workload": "Here&apos;s the basic breakdown:\n\n9 &quot;Short Assignments&quot; -- usually short programming assignments; usually due the next class day.\n4 Labs -- longer programming assignments; usually get over a week to do them.\n\nOther than that there isn&apos;t a whole lot to do. I found it useful to study over my notes (and the lecture notes posted online) after every class, just to solidify everything. (And because CS is cumulative, this is important and saves time in the long run.) Some people found the workload to be crazy, but I didn&apos;t think that was the case. Here&apos;s what I think is the key: DON&apos;T START ASSIGNMENTS THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY ARE DUE! That&apos;s super stressful, and it makes your brain turn to mush. And programming is hard when your brain has gone to mush. I found that the assignments took a much shorter amount of time when I started them early. "

    "professor": "Prof. Thomas is a fantastic professor! Her lectures are very well organized, and I found later on in the term that it wasn&apos;t necessary to try to understand the reading assignments completely because Prof. Thomas explained them so well in class. She also let the class take discussions in different directions, which was cool. For example, sometimes someone would propose a thought experiment in the middle of her lecture, and she would let us start discussing that. Yet, somehow we still managed to cover all the lecture material before exams!",
    "workload": "There was reading for each class: anywhere from 4 to 35 pages -ish. The readings were usually really hard, but like I said above, you really didn&apos;t need to understand them terribly well because they were covered so well in class. There were also 6 reading responses (like, 1-page, double-spaced, if even), which accompanied 6 of the aforementioned readings. The responses were basically just graded on whether you did them. There were 3 non-cumulative, in-class exams...if you studied your class notes, you were totally fine. Then there was a final paper, 4-6 pages. The paper involved some thought, but hey, it was the only paper of the term, so it was okay. "

    "professor": "Prof. Feyrer is very passionate about his subject. However, he isn&apos;t very good at explaining concepts to people (like me) who don&apos;t automatically understand the material. His lectures also move super fast. If you blink, you might miss a slide of his powerpoint. (Fortunately, he posts his ppt on Canvas, which was great because I found the book to be no help.) I feel like he didn&apos;t put very much time into writing his exams; in my opinion, the wording of questions was often unclear. He is also not generous with partial credit on exams.",
    "workload": "6 problem sets. Technically there was textbook reading, but I didn&apos;t do it because I thought the book was not very useful (I read, like, the first 5 chapters); instead, I read over Prof. Feyrer&apos;s powerpoints, which were pretty self-explanatory. 2 non-cumulative midterms and a final on all the material from the term. Although I found this class hard and unenjoyable, I did not think that the workload was unreasonable. "

    "workload": "The workload is very manageable. There are 6 labs, which are basically problems sets involving STATA or R (whichever you prefer to use). I highly recommend collaborating with others in the class to work on these. This was always the most efficient way to finish them off. Additionally, there is also a final paper. You can research literally anything you want. If you love IR, you can download some datasets online and crunch some numbers. If you&apos;re more of a Comparative or American guy, you can go that route as well. It&apos;s honestly up to you. Overall, I highly recommend taking this course.

    "workload": "For this course, you have to write daily journal entries. Mine were somewhere between 3 to 5 sentences each and I usually BSed them at the last minute. You won&apos;t get a letter grade for this course, but it will still count toward the Gov major. The other two courses met once a week. For each class, you had to read a book. Most of these were really interesting and were seldom longer than 200 pages. By in large,  you could also skim them. However, you can&apos;t skip them. Bafumi will know if you don&apos;t read consistently and will take that into account when he puts together your final grade. Additionally, there is a final paper for each class. One of the papers is a group assignment and the other is an individual assignment. I highly recommend not leaving these to the last minute. If you start on them by about week 5, and do a little bit whenever you have free time, you&apos;ll definitely be fine. If you meet all the basic requirements for the courses, you&apos;ll almost certainly get at least an A-. If you do a little more than what&apos;s expected of you, you&apos;ll probably get an A. Overall, I highly recommend doing this FSP. "

He will teach you A LOT about this period and he is always so nice about answering questions! Definitely stop by his office hours!",

However, all reading materials were highly relevant and, honestly, you could pick and choose which ones to read based on what you decide to write for your term paper. Aside from the reading, the exams and such are really fair. There&apos;s only one in-class written midterm consisting of 2 essay questions and then a take-home final (also 2 essay questions) and a term paper, so the workload really isn&apos;t that bad at all, until the end of the term when you have to work on the paper.
