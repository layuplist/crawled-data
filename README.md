# Layup List Data (Deprecated)

This repo used to track the crawled data used in Layup List. 

It is no longer used since the Spider application within Layup List now crawls, tracks, and imports data.

The repo tracked:
* ORC course data
* Term offerings
* Course medians
* Old layup lists and reviews (not in Spider)

This data is stored in JSON exported from the legacy crawlers.
